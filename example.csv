this game disable steam cloud saves for it this game and the steam cloud don t get along and it causes the game to occasionally crash when it tries to save here s the catch the game autosaves frequently this makes crashes more of an annoyance than anything but also a lot more frequent if you download this game make sure to disable steam cloud saves before you play it otherwise it ll constantly up unless you do some deep down work in your game files and move your save file or start over completely from scratch trust me its worth doing especially since some of the crashes will take steam down with it edit i changed the save settings and played the game for a solid three hours as of now i have not had any crashes at all trust me on this one guys the save file thing will fix most of the technical issues here now then as for the game itself in my opinion this game takes everything that ffxiii did wrong and fixes them no more scrounging for bits to upgrade your weapons slower than molasses no more endless tunnel for the first half of the game the crystal talent tree dealie is a lot easier to use and a lot more fun immediate changes gil and weapons weapon upgrades are a thing of the past you still collect bits but the bits are used to make entirely new weapons at the shop rather than simply rubbing them all over your current ones they re also a lot easier to come by also all enemies drop gil again as they should have done in ffxiii open endedness in extremely stark contrast to ffxiii s endless corridor first half that got so many gamers up in arms this time you play serah and this boy from years in the future named noel as you go all throughout time and space to unravel the mystery of time paradoxes that are plauging grand pulse you unlock new time periods and locations quickly throughout the game and it feels much more immersive than before crystalized monsters so its just serah and noel for your party members but how the hell does that work simple serah can crystalize and command monsters to fight for her remember those bits you d gather off monsters you use them to level up the guys you capture each monster is locked into a specific role cait sith is always medic for example but you can have three ready to fight alongside you at a time in addition each monster has their own feral link attack where you can use a special limit break esque trick with them in the middle of a fight costumes serah and noel both start out with four costumes their default outfits and three extra ones and they unlock more as the game goes on i assume i m not super far yet still makes it more interesting to look at thats for sure your little moogle companion mog also gains about two dozen right from the get go want a little demon moogle how about a cat perhaps a living sentient moogle plushie why not zoidberg give it time it ll get modded in and you know it outside of that here s the basic rundown pros game feels much more immersive and streamlined than before also much more engaging right from the start i went ahead and downloaded the song etro s champion off itunes after hearing it in the opening bits too so the soundtrack is solid if you skipped ffxiii or never finished it then you can watch a beginner s guide that tells the highlights of the ffxiii story and what happened through it it s split up into chapters too so you can skip the bits you already saw if you like no more scraping together gil for weapon upgrades all the monsters drop money now and the weapons are sold pre made though you can save up bits and buy custom weapons with special effects and reduced pricetags since you supplied the parts the crystal tree crystalium crystalum crystalvalium whatever is a lot easier to use now and takes a lot less grinding to get the most out of it cons beware crashes like i said above disable steam cloud saves for this title trust me on this one its not worth it the game can and will crash and burn and take steam down with it nine times out of ten graphics issues may be an issue for some personally i m fine no issues with framerate or anything but i know that was a major issue with ffxiii this game is gorgeous but it ll make your graphics card sweat it s little electronic balls off potential cons combat system is more or less the same as ffxiii if you didn t like it in that game you won t like it here not an issue for me but i know some people complained about the way combat worked in the last game read the beginner s guide if you didn t play ffxiii the game picks up three years after the ending of the last one so if you didn t play it or didn t finish it i don t blame you i liked it but even i ll admit it dragged like hell for a while then you ll be lost unless you do that overall i honestly feel like this is the kind of game that ffxiii should have been it takes what that game did right and improves on it while fixing most if not all of the problems from it if you have the money give it a whirl even if you skipped ffxiii entirely it s worth trying '],Recommended

if you didn t like the original game there just might be a chance that could still be for you the game is not linear the combat system is slightly improved and the game introduces multiple new systems and features such as paradigm pack traveling through different time periods multiple unlockable endings and throwing moogles around to your heart s content traditional world map system is replaced with historia crux a series of connected time gates you can use to access different areas and visit them in different time periods while the game does re use multiple areas most of them feel relatively fresh thanks to visiting them in different time periods completionists might also be glad to hear that it is possible to close and reopen these time gates which allows you to redo any part of the game again after finishing it meaning that there s no missable content i found the whole time travel thing a fairly solid system kind of similar to what chrono trigger had paradigm battle system is still around but this time they have introduced some new mechanics such as paradigm pack which is a system that allows you to capture different monsters you encounter and use them as your third party member it s kind of like pokemon and there s even a fragment that rewards you for catching them all it is a nice addition to the game as it s adds an extra layer of customization to your party one other improvement the combat system received was an ability to change your party leader during fights which i very much welcomed the difficulty of the game though compared to ffxiii was bit low for my taste but this is partly redeemed by the coliseum dlc included with the pc version the story continues from where final fantasy xiii left except that there s a twist lightning is gone i won t spoil any plot detail s but i ll give you a brief and vague synopsis of the beginning if you don t care feel free to skip this paragraph the game starts when this guy called noel who is from the future arrives to new bodhum meets serah lightning s sister from the original game and together they set to search lightning through these time gates which nobody really knows how they appeared in the first place of course all this gets explained later and my synopsis is terrible anyway of course this is a final fantasy game and naturally later down the road you find yourself trying to save the world from the villain who i must add is one of the best villains final fantasy games have ever had the story did feel very vague and not particularly interesting in my opinion during the first four chapters which there is six but it improves once you reach the fifth chapter characterwise serah and noel are both decent enough main characters i didn t find neither of them particularly interesting but they did the job at least serah is in my opinion much better main character than lighting was whom i simply found incredibly dull however one character that really stands out is caius ballad the main villain of the game once the story develops it becomes evident that he actually has a very clear and understandable motive for what he is doing and for a villain he actually ends up being really likeable i didn t personally like the soundtrack of the game very much but stuff like this is very very subjective and it seems that there is a great deal of people who really do enjoy it so your opinion might vary i ll just say that the game uses lots of vocal tracks some of which i found actually pretty good but they just didn t work as background music of a video game very well in my opinion japanese ending song yakusoku no basho is really good though and so probably is the english one as it s the same song with different arrangement and singer one more thing i d like to point out about the audio side of things is that i didn t really like the sound balance the sound effects were too loud and background music bit too quiet for my preferences this of course would not be a problem if the game had audio options but sadly it doesn t unlike ffxiii has tons of side quests and content you can do most of which is quite good damn it all those oerba puzzles and academia quizzes the pc version also comes with all the dlc aside from few costumes coliseum dlc has series of very difficult battles against few classic final fantasy bosses there s even ultros which offers you a nice end game challenge after you have beaten the base game lightning s dlc is kind of a prologue to the sequel lightning returns and then there s sazh s dlc which i sadly found to be a waste of time okay a final fantasy is a solid entry to final fantasy series it has some flaws but overall it s a good game however it s definitely not the best final fantasy out there nor is it a good introduction to the series if you are looking to get into final fantasy games and happened to see this in steam i d recommend to start with say final fantasy ix vii or even v or vi first still it s a good game and i do recommend it if you like jrpgs in general and do want to give newer final fantasies a bash the story is also relatively standalone so you can play it even if you haven t played final fantasy xiii and don t feel like playing that first one more thing i said nothing about the pc port because at this point probably everyone knows that it s well not very good and there s tons of other reviews that

looks gorgeous i often found myself just standing still and looking at the scenery in each area the effects are also fantastic and that is especially obvious during combat as a standard for the series the soundtrack is fantastic masashi hamauzu naoshi mizuta and mitsuto suzuki have managed to blend orchestral music with techno and dubstep and while that may seem like a recipe for disaster it s actually glorious every track is unique and memorable and the tone of each track perfectly fits the mood of the area or scene it is played at the story of the game is mostly hit or miss some people like it while others think it s needlessly complex i for one consider this one of the best stories the series has ever had i never found myself wondering what s going on everything from world events to character motivations was clear to me from the moment they were revealed the main objective of the characters the world mythos and the antagonist s plan are clear it basically revolves around serah the younger sister of the previous game s protagonist and noel a time traveller who arrives at serah s time to warn her of a dire future the game picks up years after the events of the previous game in the prologue we see lightning fighting a mysterious enemy named caius in a realm called valhalla to protect the godess etro the one who was revealed in the previous game that liberated the l cie from their cursed brands lightning sees noel emerging from a time gate and asks of him to seek out her sister serah and gives him a mission which will be revealed later she assigns a moogle that can turn into a bow named mog to give to serah then opens another game for him and proceeds to engage caius in combat once again allowing noel to escape later we see a meteor falling in the village of new bodhum one of the many human settlements built around the pillar of the crystalised cocoon where serah resides along with the nora gang also from the previous game soon after monsters attack and noel appears just in time to help serah giving her the bow to protect herself after the fight he reveals to serah and the nora members that lightning told him of weird distortions in time called paradoxes taking place and that these distortions would soon lead to the destruction of the world he said that lightning needs serah to solve these paradoxes in order for her to protect the godess in valhalla without specifying how one leads to the other noel then reveals that the meteor is a time gate through which the duo accompanied now by mog can travel through time using the historia crux the crossroads of time in their journey they will learn about lightning s true mission the motivation of this mysterious caius and his connection to noel and the godess etro and the reason time is distorted along the way they ll meet previous characters like snow hope fang and vanille and new characters all with their own missions and objectives there s also a time travelling character named chocolina who is the main vendor of weapons items and materials in the game she s basically a merchant who doubles as comic relief this is a very well written story overall and i enjoyed every second of it the gameplay is downright flawless this time around for the combat the game uses and expands upon the previous game s battle system the paradigm system the paradigm system utilizes the atb aspect of previous titles in the series but allows you to use multiple commands each character has access to every role and it s up to the player to switch between roles during battle the player controls only one character during battle the leader but you can swap leaders mid fight enabling some interesting strategies there s also an auto battle command which will automatically select which abilities the character you control will use depending on their role and the situation they re in new to this system is the option to choose whether you want your characters to focus on a single target or utilize multi target spells when using the auto battle command allowing for more freedom and customisation as a result the battles are faster but strategy is essential to defeat the tougher enemies in the game there are roles available for combat commando dps ravager mage synergist buff saboteur debuff medic healer and sentinel tank the character progression utilizes the crystarium system of ff but expands upon it each crystarium stage consists of a linear set of nodes some small and some large the player chooses which role to level up by using crystarium points cp and the available node in the crystarium stage small nodes will offer general stat boosts but large nodes will offer large boosts according to the role you chose to upgrade for example using a large node to level up the commando role will give a large attack power boost etc this allows for a lot of customisation but caution is obligatory since you can essentially lock a character out of certain stat boosts depending on how you use the large nodes leaving them under developed as a result there are playable characters and slots for recruitable monsters the monsters start off weaker than the characters but you can upgrade them using monster materials which work like cp works for the main characters later on you will learn about monster infusion and hidden monster abilities which will allow you to infuse monsters with other monsters giving them their abilities and allowing you to create the ultimate monster this is by far the best feature in the game because it allow total freedom in how you want to develop your monsters and the results are always satisfying new to the series is the accessory capacity serah and noel can equip accessories to boost their stats and gain resistances to certain elements or debuffs however unlike the previous game accessories now take up an amount of space on a character this means that if for example an item takes up points of capacity but serah only has available she can t equip it the capacity of each character starts of low but can increase as you level up using cp and completing crystarium stages it caps at in order to use all equipment slots you will need to customise the items you have in the shop to make them smaller but weaker or just use them as is and carry less sometimes it s preferred to use smaller items than or bigger ones but this depends on the player the main story isn t the focus of the game you ll find yourself spending more time doing side quests this time around each location has available side quests for you to complete in order to gain cp items or fragments which are basically the most important collectible in the game and can be used to unlock special abilities later in the game certain areas consist entirely of side quests and can be unlocked using wild artefacts used to open optional time gates and have their own side plot there s also various mini puzzles to complete and a casino area in which you can use slot machines assign tamed chocobos in races for items and money unlock special abilities using fragments and later on play poker and a fun game called chrono bind in addition to that there s a ton of optional bosses and after the final boss you will be able to replay missions and fight tougher versions of old bosses to unlock alternative paradox endings you might also find monster infusion fun depending on how much you enjoy customisation and item farming grinding isn t required but it s recommended '],Recommended

didn t think was possible this time around it not just bad porting buttons are hard mapped to the keyboard even when using a controller have to use keyboard to exit game that you have to worry about there are also ground breaking bugs that cause constant crashes to the desktop to deal with if you don t perform a few google searches first this is a crying shame as being the direct sequel to it boasts much improved game mechanics a more focused story with characters that are enjoyable to follow less character management and an easier crafting system it s a great game to play marred by the fact that it was ported in the last years and still being riddled with game breaking bugs that require a few fixes to make things workable you don t need to play the previous entry to get a rough catch up of previous events there is a very quick review available in the main menu however you would be doing yourself a major disservice by not finishing the first entry before starting this one the game starts during the previous games ending and focuses on quickly introducing a raft of new background lore which drives the entire story without spoiling the story sarah lightning s sister and noel a human from years in the future embark on a time traveling journey to bring lightning back to existence and resolve a host of time paradoxes as she has been written out of reality due to someone trying to change the events of the past the first hour is confusing but unlike the previous game it gets much clearer after that and stays enjoyable right to the end i loved the concept of the future changing the past so it aligns with the past preventing grandfather paradoxes which is something that s not often explored in games that deal with time because the game only focuses on sarah and noel the story isn t anywhere as disjointed as the previous entry this also translates into much improved gameplay as you are only focusing on characters that are always in the party with the third slot being monsters you can capture and raise which is the biggest change compared to the previous entry each monster is locked to its class but can have other monsters infused into it to get abilities it wouldn t usually be able to receive while you can ignore this function in the game if you want just levelling up the monsters you can have in your team at the same time is enough to finish the game this system does allow you to create some outrageous combos that truly buff your team also upgrading characters is much easier with a singular job tree rather than a separate to manage with cp being much easier to come by there isn t a need to grind in this game bonuses when levelling up jobs are locked to extra strength magic or life and are applied based on each crystal size the bigger crystals give more and the bonuses differ based on what class is upgraded this makes it quite easy to plan ahead to make the characters much stronger than what they would be if you just dump points randomly monsters are fed other monster drops to upgrade a set stat it also removed the annoying crafting system of the first game a weapons strength and magic are now fixed while the jobs stay the same as you unlock all jobs fairly early in the game so you get a lot more use out of the paradigm system after the previous games linear path is mostly a free for all go anywhere you want affair the story is structured around resolving time paradoxes that have arisen but there are a ton of side quests and different time periods that are available to explore to open a lot of these side areas you are required to thoroughly explore each area and complete side quests many which span across different time lines many of the objects are hidden exceedingly well you could spend hours looking so using a guide might be recommended for some quests or exploring some areas there are a few quests that require in depth knowledge of not only this game but the previous entry that require a guide to finish you also have the option of go to a casino and play on the slots or chocobo racing to mix things up visually the looks great much like its predecessor though there are less areas to explore because the game revolves around visiting the same areas in different times or alternate realities each area can look different but it cuts down on the total amount of areas to explore this game is set entirely on gran pulse with some new cities and places outside the flow of time each area can be revisited at any point with main story events being replayed from the start or continuing from where you previously left an area though each area time will contain many secrets and different enemies most of the assets have been reused from the previous games with only a few newer characters being introduced you now have the option of changing your outfit and adding accessories there are plenty of in game movie sequences however they don t outstay their welcome and do propel the story forward to mix things up there are a lot of qte events during battles and movie sequences which can help you end fights quicker if you succeed in them the voice acting is still excellent though they dropped the australian accents of the people of pulse fang and vanille still have their accents having the previous characters play bit roles wasn t too bad and the scripts for them were a lot better this time around there is a lot less whingeing and crying this time around by hope as well as a lot less angst by the remaining cast which makes it much more enjoyable to listen to the music is outstanding with a mix of full vocal as well as different styles there is one heavy metal fight song it reminds me of dmc series as well as a wild chocobo which i will miss listening to as mentioned before the bugs are ground breaking but can be fixed without doing anything i found the game constantly crashed when changing camera views which happens at the end of battle i fixed this by running a party patch which increases the amount of ram it can use this stopped the crashes but sometimes enemies wouldn t display i had to turn off steam cloud saves to resolve that and the game has been fine since you shouldn t have to put up with these errors for a aaa release but at least you can fix them the dlc s are included and explain what snow lightning and sazh are doing all become available after the main game is finished and reward you with extra monster summons in the shape of the listed characters or other well know characters from the ff series i would only bother with the lightning one as it s a canonical ending taking a few hours to finish the fight sazh s one has you focusing on playing poker while snow has you fighting in the coliseum against some well know characters from other ff games if you are wanting to the game it s a much easier task this time around you level up much quicker and only a few of the fights right at the end will prove to be difficult with a fully upgraded party

predecessor from improved exploration to the non existence of a hour tutorial to the way you encounter enemies while perhaps taking a hit in other aspects but overall it should be said that does surpass xiii and it also unveils the actual mythos behind the fabula nova crystallis while very similar to xiii it does bring some quality of life improvements finally being able to change party leaders during enemy encounters which leads to not losing battles when your party leader is downed despite the two other members being alive which was in my opinion a flaw of xiii and a departure from classic final fantasy the level design while still somewhat linear does lead to more exploration and choices while walking around it clearly is a step up from xiii but it continues the linearity the franchise has had since final fantasy x in a myriad of ways does mirror it has a similar level selector the historia crux mirrors the celsius such as being able to visit every biome that existed in the previous games in a non linear form while both predecessors you walked the world in a linear progression following the party s journey to their destiny speaking more in depth about the changes to combat the paradigm pack is a nice addiction with a somewhat pokemon style system that is to say during the game you may catch crystals that contain the monsters that you defeated and they may help you in battle and each monster has a given role attributed to them that is immutable you level their crystarium with components that you either randomly gain during battles or chests during the game or buy them through the shop system in there are various tiers of components for each type of beast be they robot or l cie or biological and as pokemon have ev s read effort value which are mutable characteristics there s also an infusion system in the game that i did not delve much into but to summarise it you infuse a given beast with the crystal of another s so that they may gain said beast s passive ability the last thing about gameplay should be the crystarium while in this game we still use a crystarium it has changed to be less linear you do not have paths for each character you only follow path that has stages and that are not gate kept by your progress in the main journey unlike xiii s in this iteration of the crystarium each role is attributed a level that goes up to level each role favours a stat be it strength magic or hp and when you level a role you get a bonus for the stat that said role favours usually serah is the magic user while noel is the attack user you may only focus on commando for example and leave every role at level there is absolutely no restrictions and if you do end up levelling a role to in early crystarium stages it costs little because the cp costs are tied to the crystarium s stages not the the level of the role you are levelling final fantasy xiii was the first one to be released under the umbrella of the fabula nova crystallis but while xiii deals with theme of defying destiny and focuses on crystals such as early entries in the franchise it doesn t delve much into the mythos of the goddess etro that the cancelled versus xiii was supposed to deal with right from the get go as with the gameplay the initial setup for this game also mirrors setup in the fact that each of their predecessors doesn t foreshadow a sequel or has an emerging intrigue starting in their ending neither does either one need a sequel both games reach conclusive endings on their own without the need for a follow up which leaves the setup for both feeling maybe forced and unnecessary nonetheless both games bring interesting gameplay and are worth the play the game starts year after xiii s events which is dubbed af after the fall of cocoon serah is living in what is called new bodhum in gran pulse which is populated by the familiar faces that lived in the original one but we soon learn that shortly after xiii s ending lightning disappears mysteriously and suddenly monsters appear in the town and with them comes a strange fellow called noel that says he arrived there from valhalla where he found lightning protecting the goddess etro s throne and he informs serah that to reach valhalla and save her sister they must journey through time fixing paradoxes the game introduces us to valhalla to the goddess etro and to broader themes of the fabula but does it so in a way that sometimes can feel disconnected from the original game the characters may suffer less characterization given the more non linear progression of the story that was one of the upsides to xiii s linearity and some of the supposed emotional scenes may come out as cheap same with some of the plot twists but overall tells a decent enough humanist story with the overall theme of the fabula that is defying destiny or dying trying similarly to its predecessor the ost of this game is decent enough there are some songs that are quite well one that strikes me the first time that i heard it was the one in the seaside in one of the more advance levels but for the seasoned final fantasy fan it doesn t come close to the legendary ost of past entries made by the legendary nobuo uematsu the original endgame of this game rubbed me in a way more positive light versus the endgame of xiii it was way less grindy and the fragment list was actually fulfilling to complete unlike the trapezohedron grind of the previous game although the hardest bosses either played exactly like the previous one or very similarly but that point ends up being fixed with one of the dlcs there are a few dlcs i ve read that square enix s dlc practice for this game and others for that matter was quite consumer unfriendly but for the steam version everything comes with this purchase some of these dlcs are spoiler heavy and so will be my review about them sazh s story heads or tails the objective and gameplay is quite dull the synopsis for this story is that sazh s son has disappeared and for him to recover his son he must play poker at the universal casino when translating this concept to execution it really ends up being a really boring dlc and its plot implications are simply to explain how sazh appears at the end of the game to help out serah and the crew snow s story perpetual battlefield this dlc is the one that can really satiate the more hardcore players with it s fights you find yourself in an universal omnitemporal colosseum where you fight various enemies from xiii s universe or related to common final fantasy mythos and a special appearance from ultros a final fantasy vi classic lightning s story requiem of the goddessthis dlc and the secret ending that you acquire after getting fragments is the one that connects to lightning returns something that should have been done to connect xiii to the gameplay for this is somewhat fun it requires you to fight caius and lose enough times until you become strong enough to beat him and witness the ending of the dlc overall this game is a step up from its prequel and while xiii is overly criticised in final fantasy circles this game helps clear this trilogy s reputation for those that dare to play it also this port

play them in a very old windows xp and a windows computer back then those games was always refreshing and broke the usual norms held by video games i always wanted to play ffxiii series it was a dream to me regardless of course i jumped to without playing the prequel for various reasons i did saw a lot of videos related to ffxiii and i could say it s more epic than this but i think it was a bit too much when people say that is bad compared to most final fantasy games in terms of bugs is indeed bad and frustrating but you have to understand this is a badly ported game and i never let that bothered me really there are many workarounds for the bugs and some worked for me with that said i managed to get all of the achievements most were ridiculous completed the dlc and the main story and my judgment is the story is epic since the bugs were bad i d first start the review with that the bugs for me did not happen overnight it happened when i was a little bit into the game up to bresha ruins for the first time and crashed when i was riding the chocobo there were glitches in saving sometimes and that sucked when taking screenshots the game would crash a lot i felt like the steam overlay is insanely slow when i was in the game too the fix what worked for me is mostly running the game using the nvidia processor rather than the onboard which is since it s a laptop pc users won t have probs and making the game play in the windowed mode also taking breaks from time to time helped too memory tweaking such as increasing the userva could be done to allocate more memory to the game if you want this was the fix that works of the time but no matter what it was really hard to enjoy the game when there is an immense fps drop there were many ways to tweak this in the forums but ofc i did not follow the methods because of the fear that the game would break more the story is totally related to the first final fantasy game and it continues from there lighting is fighting in a place called valhalla noel comes from the future and lighting asks him to get help from her sister and serah takes the job however you are supposed to travel timelines to different periods and eras to go through the full story the story also involves the farseers of padra who are like the messengers of goddess etro and the guardians who protect them the game is a mental relief for people who were obsessed with ffxiii since the characters from that version appears here this story has several endings depending on the fragments you collect collect all fragments and you can get a secret ending the version i bought had the dlc also and that includes the real ending in a side story after the main final battle is done i never really liked serah s character much but you have to admit that she has a noble personality lightning was fascinating putting a strong upfront always this is noel s game for me since he seems more powerful more headfast straightforward and strong most of my friends know that i was literally obsessed with noel and it was not strange because it was his personality that helped me through the dark times the villain himself could not be characterized as a villain since if you take his point of view you can justify him the most loved characters for some players such as hope esthiem seems really cool and interesting the chemistry between the characters are great especially noel and serah i don t care what anyone says but serah is more fitting for noel than anyone else snow seems too uh big for serah idk compared to the old ff games the battle actions have initially changed a lot i noticed but i found that more realistic and challenging so it was great i missed using the guardian forces though but taming monsters and fusing them seems so creative battle paradigms were a total new thing to me but i really liked it there were some unfair battles here and there but the usage of the fragment skills made everything easier to keep it short and sweet i will name some of the unique features you can play casino and get nice prizes chocobo races in casino requires you to have a high level chocobo to win fragment skills get unlocked when you collect fragments of each time portal and it has stuff like earning more cp monster crystals choices are important in the game dialogues replaying each level with a specific fragment skill would trigger hard boss fights and may unlock a different ending paradox endings hard monsters which have very rare dropout rates for precious items getting the ultima weapon is quite hard very nice side quests that requires some work time travelling each location might have multiple time portals so finding fragments for one location can depend on another closing time portals and replaying levels to get different endings when the commando and ravager roles are maxed you get two powers each for noel and serah they are cool staggering and chain making seems interesting and creative the dialogues the bystanders say are so funny lol chocobocolina is here to sell you some awesome goods also i m not sure if it was the part of dlc but sazh s side story is pursued later in the game in the casino place technically i also loved the battle moves and i never depend much on items except wound potions but i really missed skills such as casting aura by myself because such features are attributed to the monsters in this game leveling up seems kind of nice since it s separated for each role also just because you have leveled up doesn t mean that you get the max strength you need good weapons and accessories i didn t like the limited capacity for the accessories but oh well i like changing the outfits but i hoped there were more outfits for both serah and noel mog of course had many the dlc content have a side story for lightning which includes the real secret ending the battle itself is very hard unless you max out lightning you should get a five star rating battle result to get into the second half of the fight which is harder and slower than the first one the fights in the colossiuem could be unlocked if you have the dlc which is kinda interesting you can unlock the opponents you fight and level them up in the crystarium it was pleasures to beat omega and lightning in the colossieum i expect the weapons available in the shops higher than the ultima weapons are from the dlc as well as usual ff games never fail to disappoint me in creating stunning visuals which are breathtaking every battle i fight is so satisfying just because of that every main character looks like some kind of a god like deity lol the landscapes are stunning especially academia the music is good but i prefer the music in ffxiii better also the designing of clothes and weapons seems so fascinating and intricate the names of the weapons are also very unique it s close to my culture and i can understand the meaning of the names some achievements here seem a lot tougher to get and frustrating clockstopper requires you to get preemptive strikes without break the lucky coin fragment which you can get from the casino by playing slots is also mighty hard to take players have to tape the tab button on the keyboard and wait for hours to get it but i don t think that works i had to go into super victory mode and then take the game by myself and i randomly got it it actually requires luck that gameplay saddlesore and getting all the monsters for the fragments is time consuming it s a nice rpg overall but the bugs can kill you so be aware of it epic story and gameplay though

most simultaneously epic yet solemn final fantasy games ever also yes is it a better game than the original perhaps possible spoilers for and ahead first off this game exponentially adds to the lore and mythos of the twin worlds of cocoon and pulse but in doing so dampens the sacrifice that took place at the end of when the game starts we are introduced to the driving force of the first game s narrative and lighting s sister serah farron who has been living on pulse in the town of new bodum shortly after awakening from a dream about her now long missing sister lightning fighting someone at the end of time a time paradox opens yes it s one of those stories and the town is attacked by futuristic monsters and serah meets up with new characters noel and mog the story of the game then centres around serah and noel fighting and closing time paradoxes in an attempt to prevent the now crystalline cocoon from crashing down and ushering in the end of the world overall the story is intriguing and well written in regard to tackling the main themes of despair loneliness and sacrificing the many in order to save the ones you love if not a bit short on the topic of gameplay the paradigm system from has been greatly overhauled now opposed to party members that change based on the story there are only permanent party members serah and noel and the other party slot is occupied by any of creatures you ve captured in battle think less pokemon and more persona as it is luck based who occupies a single paradigm this was a novel inclusion as it makes party compositions feel more unique as you have access to almost every basic enemy to add to your party train and customise with humorous attire but despite this does not make up for not having a third character in the party as all the dialogue tends to be between serah noel and mog who is practically useless gameplay wise other than for completionist purposes overall the lack of a wider party really sells serah s excitement for reuniting with snow who also went missing and noels sense of loneliness being the last person alive in the end of time combat wasn t the only thing that was changed as the chrystarium was also completely overhauled this time rather than progress being tied to story events a new chrystarium would unlock as soon as the old one was completed this made progression feel a lot more fast paced and less like it was intrinsically tied to the plot paradigms also received some updates as now the sen paradigm negates more damage than in and this feature is made apparent from the very start this leads to combat being more fast paced but also more challenging in places one final change to the gameplay formula is that random encounters are back but work on a system more akin to persona than to a traditional final fantasy game where an enemy randomly spawns you have the chance to attack first to gain an advantage or flee and if you get hit by the enemy you start with a disadvantage honestly i prefer this system as it means preemptive strikes are far easier to get as you aren t sat in the gapra whitewood waiting for that bastard behemoth to turn around just for the chance of a preemptive strike not to mention that now you can change the party leader mid fight so now the annoying death of a party leader leading to the loss of a fight in is replaced by the death of a party member nothing more nothing less for the most part the changes to the gameplay are welcome additions in my eyes and help to make the combat more enjoyable and engaging the level design has also been altered for this sequel this time around square really took the criticism of corridor levels to heart and as a consequence the levels and the way they are connected feel way too open this seems like a good idea but now rather than being stuck at the end of a corridor you actually took wrong turns and have gone through different time zones only to find out through a decade old youtube guide that you went through the wrong time portal and went several millennia in the wrong direction as for the area design that is a completely different story final fantasy continues to hold the bar set by its predecessor and in some instances surpasses it conveying not only the state of the world to the player but also the emotions of the characters using the contrast of the same area being perfectly fine in one timeline and utterly demolished in another to sell the urgency of saving cocoon and its inhabitants as a result of your time tampering not only do you save the many lives of cocoon but you also get a glimpse into the more personal effects of your actions with the character of alyssa zaielle who you witness grappling with the knowledge that they themselves are a time paradox and should have died if not for the player altering time now for the real reason anyone would play a final fantasy game the villain caius ballad is the eternal sworn protector of yuel the seeress who is continually fated to die at approximately years old understandably this leaves caius distraught as the one person he loves dearest is ripped from him prematurely leaving countless iterations of him alone caius acts as a foil to noel as they are both people confronted with immense loss but the way they handle it is completely different as where noel sees hope and is seen as a light in the dark caius seeks only chaos and destruction on the topic of chaos i would like to discuss this game s implications on the wider story of the universe with the end if you see the entire party save fang i believe transform into ceith then to shortly later revert back into people tries to explain this by introducing the unseen character of etro the goddess of death who it turns out took pity upon the party and used her powers to revert the party this caused a time paradox which was resolved by lightning being sacrificed and imprisoned by the chaos until the end of time in valhalla which in turn led to the death of etro whose heart the heart of chaos is stored inside caius this is an interesting addition to the lore as it shows that there are beings above the likes of the fal cie who possess the power to rewrite history as none of this was referenced in the first game this makes it feels less planned and more like a slapdash effort especially with bunevelze s introduction in lighting returns after numerous fights with caius and saving the population of cocoon the game s climax takes place as a battle against caius in valhalla at the end of time this leads to either noel killing caius or his suicide based on the player s choice this then leads to the heart of chaos being shattered setting the events of lightning returns into motion like it s predecessor this game has excellent music with a large selection of high energy tracks as well as loads of more typical final fantasy music with each area having an alternate version of the song for when an enemy appears and tries to attack you which helps sell the sense of upcoming action with the next fight like with the area design the ost also contains some more sombre tracks which succeed with selling the emotion of the comparatively darker story overall while this review was fairly positive in its tone i would like to add that there are flaws with the game the actual story is relatively simple and more of a vessel for the interesting themes and during the latter half the game becomes extremely tedious as in without a guide this game would be over hours long levels of tedious it also ends on a cliffhanger that only serves as a way to sell lighting returns which i won t get into but if you liked you should like tis game '],Recommended

mysterious traveler noel and moogling mog to make things right despite putting hours into i m about as equipped to discuss the plot as somebody who has never even heard of the game or final fantasy i guess this title could be compared to previous square games like chrono trigger chrono cross the player must pass through various times and dimensions alleviating paradoxes fighting monsters and getting pushed around by some jerk named caius there are dark moments like chrono but it sticks to characters instead of attempting to juggle like cross i guess that s part of what got me through this game when the story doesn t make a lot of sense at least you can watch the friendship between noel serah grow and realize that they re getting by despite the heaps of bs being tossed their way the battle system is straight outta ffxiii but with numerous changes the most obvious is that the third party member is always a monster pocket monster fans are going to find dozens of creatures to recruit throughout their journey monsters are strengthened via materials and can be infused with others to gain additional skills admittedly i was a little disappointed that monsters adhere to the ffxiii system for example i recruited a giant cactaur but he s not going around using needles on everything he s a synergist so he sticks entirely to buffs i know i know the paradigms are essential to winning in ffxiii but i just oh well on the bright side monsters tend to have unique skills that make them more effective in a given situation than serah noel on the whole is a fair bit easier than its predecessor this is mostly due to the fact that you re actually not limited in how much you can grind since this game is non linear you could go to various optional areas and amass a ton of levels making the story battles trivial aside from a handful of post game dlc fights you ll have to limit yourself if you want a challenge speaking of levels the crystarium got a convoluted revamp you cash in points for stat bonuses to magic to hp etc over time you unlock and level all six roles but your level stats can vary there s a perfect guide floating around to help you figure this mess out while i ended up using guides to have a chance at this game i merely stuck to leveling what i thought would make sense for serah i leveled ravager on the large nodes to boost her magic and with noel commando i probably goofed somewhere and cost myself a good points in an essential stat but i ve done most everything in the game so it isn t that much of an issue in order to get all fragments you re going to be doing a lot of exploring grinding puzzles and stupid pet tricks mog is capable of finding hidden items and can also be thrown to reach faraway objects which you might need a guide to find the puzzles are almost entirely mini games as anyone who has played will tell you the clock puzzles suck most of them aren t that difficult and can be brute forced but there are a few that all but require a website for calculating solutions either take advantage of the tools the internet has made available to you or watch in horror as the pacing dies a painful death your choice the grind isn t quite as bad as ffxiii but expect to spend a lot of time in the archylte steppe fighting the same monsters for potent orbs essences crystals after completing the game all of the major dlc is unlocked in the coliseum players will engage in battle with numerous fan favorites and a few characters from ffxiii i find it amusing that one of the opponents should have been in a boss fight in ffxiii but it never happened because reasons i won t spoil it but if you played ffxiii then you already know who i m talking about you ll want to fight these battles not just because they re quite good but also because you can recruit everyone you defeat the next dlc adventure is a solo battle between lightning and caius lightning has a specific set of roles and is expected to switch between them constantly for example she can use the knight role to become impervious to damage and it s necessary to avoid getting one shotted by a handful of caius s attacks since this dlc doesn t require serah noel you can do it immediately after completing the game to gain a powerful ally sazh s dlc adventure takes place in a casino he s trapped in limbo and his son is nowhere to be found only by gambling can they hope to be re united while the concept sounds sufficiently dark this isn t exactly gambling apocalypse sazh the goal is to acquire fortune medals which can be done in less than minutes by playing texas hold em the casino is also available in the main game though all n s can do is play slots and race their chocobos once i got the items i required i never went back i ll admit i enjoyed my time with this game more than ffxiii noel serah and caius are some of the better jrpg heroes and villains i ve seen trying to make sense of everything is headache inducing but the revamped crystarium and monster raising provided excellent distractions the combat itself also recieved some slight improvements like paradigm shifting being noticeably faster the various areas times dimensions being more than a narrow corridor definitely helped though the quests tend to be of the fetching variety the port still could have been a lot better though i m not nearly as frustrated about it now as was when i

playing through it i have to agree this game have serious flaws and i will discuss in the spoiler section down below graphic of this game is still pretty awesome for a game years old music and sound effect are very nicely done one of the riding chocobo theme song and back ground bgm of dyeing world is particularly beautiful and masterfully done since it s a port of final fantasy and we all know square does very bad support when its games are ported to pc there will always be a lot problem to fix all the crush and graphics bug etc lucky for us there is a full guide on steam community that fix every issue for me and i was able to get game running smoothly after about half an hour of fixing the story is what i call a branched tree with a linear root you are free to explore what you want on the story tree branch of each different time period but eventually you have gone to the story main root without deviations in fact you kind of have to explore nearly every tree branches eventually anyways to proceed smoothly cut scene and combat design are very nicely done some of the fight scene and live action trigger are very nicely designed and wonderful eye candy control and combat are very simple to use but needs a bit customization to work actually effectively i do believe there are a lot player finished the game without knowing how to switch between single target spell focus and aoe spell focus monster taming is actually pretty fun and if after finishing the game and go to coliseum you can fight a whole bunch of fun character such as snow lighting and even omega weapon from they are also all tamable i caught a lighting myself and it s actually really fun to have her on the team and make it also feel like a player game instead of player team you can also dress up your monster with the ornaments you get in the game and transfer passive skill from other monster to your favorite ones too bad potent items are rare drops in the game and you can only buy them after your finish the main game ok that s it i will give this a game and a thumb up barely i guess i still enjoyed the game enough to recommend it barely and it just hurts to see a finally fantasy game scored so low so i will bump it up a little why i rated it so low well read the following spoiler sections spoiler below well problem of this game is logic storyline logic and design choice logic first is the storyline is super messy and logic is weird ffxiii finish with a miracle by goddess etro she personally saved your entire team from the crystal fate except of them doing so she got weak and released the chaos and destroyed the world she was able to use last of her strength to reseal chaos and go into a slowly dying crystal sleep herself doing so she was able to restore most of the timeline except main hero lighting fall to valhalla to became a guardian of the sleeping goddess and thus create a time paradox the ripple through the ages that paradox cause effect up and down the history and watcher of history yeul was killed because she now sees a different version of history which caused a future guardian of yeul angry at the goddess and came to valhalla to confront the goddess and lighting in this battle between lighting and guardian caius the last human at end of human history which is also the last guardian noel fall through time gate into valhalla realize an end of world situation is unavoidable lighting sent noel to find her sister and bring her to valhalla her sister serah was a far seer that s not yeul team up with noel which is the only one that can kill caius team up to fix history while changing history to try to get to valhalla to meet up lighting this caused many yeul in many histories saw different version of history and dying over and over which caused caius to go crazy to change more history and go to valhalla after sending noel and serah on their mission to fix break history lighting conceded in battle again caius and froze herself in crystal and waiting for the hero team to break the history and caused the end of world end of the world then happen when your main character team s triumph and then your main playable character serah dies and end of world happens after the end of the world then she will be the only one spared and go on journey herself to fix everything herself and that s story of lighting return yes huge wall of text with character story and timeline mixed together with complicated relationship between multiple people simple put a goddess made a mistake that screwed up everything lighting end up choose to trick he sister to try to save the world but instead of breaking history line that caused end of the world which lighting herself world be spared and wake up in her crystal sleep later to fix the world herself in third game of the series i am speechless for this weird design choice logic of the game whose idea is it to create complicated math clock puzzle that you have to solve repeated in the game and its time limited for minute for god sake i am pretty good at math and i can solve this by writing it down and test it but in minute solve a puzzle with clock location is nearly humanly impossible you will probably have to pause the game write down the number do the home work then solve the puzzle whose idea to put keys of wild artifact in weird location you have to find those little things to proceed and at least are not easily found with no hint given on where they are this is a open world game that have a lot ground to cover one of them need to you answer a certain way doing a live trigger event if you miss you have to find gate seal to seal it then redo the story again and it s super long whose idea to do the final maze in plat former setting this is not a platform game

determining your own destiny highs are much higher than xiii s combine that with the game giving you access to xiii s combat system s full potential from the get go great as always music is worth playing if you managed to get through xiii hell skipping xiii jumping straight to wouldn t be the worst idea given the story does sideline most of the first game s main cast focuses on new characters and serah but she was a crystal for most of xiii anyway now i ll have to see if lightning returns keeps up this momentum especially given that cliffhanger long version in many ways final fantasy is a product of its circumstances it as well as its sequel lightning returns review coming soon is a game that mainly exists due to the calamitous launch of final fantasy xiv doing a lot of damage to the company the need to recoup the money lost on that disaster somehow and with final fantasy versus xiii still deep in development hell and still a couple of years away from being turned into final fantasy xv and xiv being in no position to do so on its own without an expensive ground up rebuilding of the game square ended up deciding that cashing in on the commercial success of final fantasy xiii making a sequel or two to it that heavily reused technology assets from xiii was the best option it is also a product of its circumstances due to its design choices which were a mix of walking back things people hated about xiii working within a more limited budget due to square enix s financial troubles at the time due to the aforementioned failure of ffxiv a then recent acquisition of eidos and their studios ex crystal dynamics eidos montreal following design trends of the late era of gaming for instance the linear structure of xiii is replaced with a much more open ended one where you can play most missions during the middle portion of the game in any order you please although the cutscenes do feel written with a particular order in mind there are also much fewer pre rendered cinematics than xiii down to that book end the story plus a couple of extensions of xiii s ending cinematic whether this decrease is down to budgetary restrictions the short for an rpg development cycle leaving little time for more cinematics a desire to cram the entire game onto a single xbox dvd the first game was made with the blu ray discs in mind the port had to be split across dvds as a result of all the pre rendered cinematics and even then they were of a lower resolution bitrate different video format than the cutscenes the xbox one backcompat versions have cutscenes encoded in a proprietary sony developed format reencoded in bink video for the xbox one while the xbox pc have cutscenes in the bink video format that are highly compressed or a combination of the above is unclear but the end result is the same the visuals while pretty good for are also mostly just coasting off of reused assets from xiii presumably another result of the circumstances of this game s creation although what new assets are present are some of the best looking things in the entire game and do hold up against other games of that year like uncharted drake s deception the combat is a strange topic for me with regards to this game on one hand not much has changed compared to xiii with the biggest changes being the ability to change party leaders mid fight the addition of a pokemon persona esque monster catching mechanic almost certainly to make up for the lack of a character to fill that third slot due to noel serah being the only two protagonists but on the other hand i also enjoyed combat a lot more than xiii s i actually rage quit xiii almost halfway through because of the combat to be honest i can t quite put my finger on why but i think it s related to how gives you access to the full potential of its combat system early whereas xiii consistently leaves you with only two party members until past the halfway point of the game by which point many players myself included will have quit that or the drastically reduced difficulty could also be that as for the story it s a significant improvement over xiii the presence of a clear antagonist throughout the story whereas xiii didn t really have one until well into the act who has a clear goal helps give the story clearer stakes a persistent emotional throughline said emotional throughline is focused around of this game s new characters noel kriess one of the protagonists along with serah caius ballad the main antagonist yeul a young girl who can see the future changes to the timeline at the cost of a drastically shortened lifespan eternal reincarnation and caius s charge and made me to tear up numerous times it s not perfect though this game s time travel rules are very convoluted for example the game makes a big deal about how changing the future changes the past but they also allow players to revisit timelines that should have been overwritten by such changes for example there are two versions of academia circa af af being short for after the fall of cocoon you can visit in the game both of them are accessible whenever you please once you ve unlocked them presumably for gameplay reasons due to this game s non linear structure overall i liked it though one thing i should note is that the pc port of this game is a mess it s unstable has performance issues no matter what hardware you run is prone to crashing fortunately though there are mods out there that fix these issues this steam guide should help you get this game to a more stable state on pc if you d rather not deal with mods i d suggest playing the xbox version on an xbox one one x xbox series x or series s instead for a better out of the box experience conclusion final fantasy is a step forward from the first game but is very much an iterative sequel at least the story is surprisingly good for a game slapped together in less than years to keep a company afloat ratings creative score story gameplay voice acting art direction score graphics audio performance pretty good graphics for its day but the pc port is terrible business practices score not terrible but there was a lot of dlc for this game including some

giving a neutral option for a game recommendation i can hardly adjust this game s value by a fair feeling you can ask if i like this game or not i can give a straight answer but recommend to someone no i have no idea about the tastes of the readers are and by far final fantasy is amazing at some point however it also has massive flaws that i just hated every minute of playing them it is very difficult to judge a complex game like this by simply overall using yes or no options in the end before i get myself started i want to point out this review will be different from my major reviews on steam i will compare final fantasy to its predecessor final fantasy xiii along the way in hope to give a detailed picture of how this game evolved and its position in xiii s trilogy there isn t any meaning to put ff within the entire ff games in comparison since each ff game is completely different and the timeline would be too long to discuss and ff probably by far won t at the top among its ancestors positive facts major changesstory in my personal opinion ff got better story than xiii more interesting story telling methods meanwhile carries the legacy xiii has left on its own ending there is no doubt that ff is the true sequel of ff xiii regardless brand new system this probably is the most praised part of the game since is a lot more customized than xiii refers to how you proceed the story open world maps how you raise your team members in favour of your own strategies on battle the game basically gives the players a lot more freedom about how you wish to play and what you are going to discover willingly it is another step forward comparing to xiii in sum mc monster leveling system it is arguable this system is a big step forward or backdrops in general it has its positive side meanwhile bearing some flaws at the same time i ve put the positive tip here also going to discuss its negative part in the flaw section in ff xiii you have protagonists to play through the entire story and each one of them will eventually reach its exactly same maxed state every gamer will get the same result no matter how he she levels these characters which also means the party members fought on battle is also deadly set with the same states in ff however the party member on battle is replaced by a monster that you can tame from the wilds similar like pokermon games your party on battle can have up to monsters in action with endless number for diversity collection purposes each monster has its advantages and shortages they all grow differently and follow its special hidden rules i say hidden because in game it never explains clearly what is the best way that suits each catalog of monsters to level up this massive change made entire leveling system stylised since every player can end up unique party on his her own depends on how he she uses the upgrade materials and complex at the same time there are huge gaps between well leveled party and poorly optimized ones memorable soundtracks best on its own no further description needed carries some of the xiii s popular bgms and created even more powerful and addicting new ones listen to them you will know why i love them this much flawstoo complicated leveling system customized system would be a good thing however it also raised many problems at the same time because the in game tutorial is simple and straight forward it never reached its proper function by fully demonstrating the complexity of the monster growing system along with the developments of the protagonists serah and noel how do they work in need to extend to their best potentials what if the players are so desire the result is you either read multiple guides before you even start playing the game and carefully following them while playing kinda spoil the fun by freely exploring the game or playing the game blindly like me later to find out the situation could be so much better if you read a well explained guide and knowing the natural rules of this complex customized leveling system for your team members on battle either way there is no reset button in the game and this can t be good but fall into a deep pit of flaws irritable none optional mini games it supposes to be fresh and exchanging mood by implanting some cute mini games within ff but it is never be a good idea to add a meanie mini game that purely winning by random ai s orders chances from the gods maybe with no other way around no skillful play can fix it or needed no alternative ways to go through it apart from thinking of using a cheat engine what s worse you re forced to play it until you won if you want to see the whole picture of the game which means you would be stuck with it for long if unlucky like me again yeah i am talking to you slot machine i don t know what the original purpose was by inserting this terrible idea into the game but for me it is a brick from the sky in ff for sure frustrating dlcs now if i ve completed the whole game with nothing left apart from the dlcs with hours or more were played the very last thing i can expect from dlcs is more frustrating content of purely battles with super tough enemies to beat in exchange for what have chances to recruit them to my party well i m exhausted after the entire long journey in ff world you see and i ve maxed out pretty much every single monster i need to beat the main game in completion including the also maxed out serah and noel then this dlcs tells me that your party is nothing if you dare to challenge them yeah i admit that i lost interests half way after beating half of the enemies in dlcs not worth it i won t spend another hour to level them up even if i get their crystals by chance afterwards there is not a single boss left in main game that i didn t challenge that i can test them out except the dlc battles and i swear some of the battles you won t want to fight them again once you ve done them believe me instead no real new story here nothing fresh in general the game would be much better without dlcs massing around if you ask me alright i think it is pretty much of it scarlet score p s if the devs knew where to stop it could

story is radically different without giving away too much there is some divine intervention the results of which cause damage to the timeline alters history and allows a select few to use mysterious time gates that have appeared throughout the timeline serah with the help of noel a boy from the far future is one such person i loved the whole concept of how the story unfolds in this game instead of a world map you get a time gate map seen from outside time where you can pick and choose places and times to go to based on what gates you have unlocked granted there is going to be some recycled content in terms of maps but there are quite a few new ones so it doesn t grate on your experience so much academia is stunning in terms of its size and it has probably the largest number of people you are likely to see at one time in a ff title that is not in a cutscene naturally you can expect a framerate hit here valhalla is impressive as well but sadly only available in the intro scenes but augusta tower and noel s timezone help give it some variety and new material too enemies are probably going to irritate some folks for its lack of new material with maybe one or two new creations and everything else having already existed from ffxiii there is a notable lack of superbosses as well unless you include the dlc battles which partly helps to make up for this but some of the best fun to be had with battles comes from the monster capture ability serah sometimes gets a monster crystal from defeated monsters allowing them to be developed like a main character and also allowing myriad customisation with the help of infusions where you can feed a monster to one of your other monsters you can have up to monsters in your paradigm deck meaning only those ones can be active in any given battle and only one at a time to fill out the team of serah noel and a monster i find it weird they use the term monster when most of the time they re just animals anyway you can get some pretty crazy team combos such as three different coloured chocobos chocobos are great fun there s yellow red green blue purple black white gold and silver with so many different chocobos you just knew there d be chocobo racing too right some monster skills in combat actually stand for racing abilities when you enter the chocobo into the races so there s another aspect to building your chocobos that can be quite profitable too with an achievement for filling out your bestiary to you re going to want to look up some guides to help you out monster infusions can be a bit confusing too with abilities having different ranks of importance and terms like red locked and yellow locked abilities so it s worth looking up some builds too where others have already done the work for you music is on par with other ff titles i bought the soundtrack and let me see i have or so favourites from this game not the least of which are and the last of which is kind of death metally kind of funny typically an area will have music then monsters appear and the music will elevate into a remix which is a really neat idea character wise sadly there isn t much of lightning unless you get her crystal from the dlc fight she ll make an appearance here and there but serah is the main protagonist here there s a few costume alternatives for her and noel but not much there are brief cameos from ffxiii characters most notably hope but the new villain of the story is probably the best part voiced by liam o brien one of my all time favourite voice actors who also voiced kain from ffiv the voiced version he has the sort of voice i wish i had you can also play of the game on easy mode if you wish there is but a single enemy raspatil that requires you to kill it on normal but you can change difficulty at any time during the game a word of warning though too on easy there is no loot bonus for battles on normal you get a bonus to items and rare items when you a battle and even normal mode is pretty easy a neat feature is the inclusion of minigames in the form of dimensional rifts the games take the form of join the dots join the crystals of the same colour collect crystals on a grid of tiles that disappear after you walk on them and clock puzzles which aren t nearly as hard as people make them out to be where you have to land on each direction of the clock to finish the puzzle with alternate paradox endings

biggest highlight is the incredible music and the voice acting of one of the main characters caius liam o brien is a fantastic voice actor and he fit the role perfectly for the only interesting character in the entire game lets go into a deep dive into why i hate this game and why i honestly think pretty much anyone should be avoiding this disaster to begin lets talk about the games concept its very rare for the final fantasy series mainline games to get sequels ff is pretty much the main example and that sequel had a lot of problems as well ff pretty much has some of the most horrific writing i have seen serah and a new character called noel take center stage into a time traveling trip through the locations of ff this is an excellent chance to explore the wide cast of characters and locations in the first game that didn t get explored including serah which was such an incredibly important character to the story now tell me how in a hour game with all these new characters you somehow developed none of them even the most interesting character basically gets left on a bunch of question marks once you finish the game every other character is downright horrible especially the main characters serah has personality and somehow shows less development here compared to ff where she barely said anything for the entire game noel is just supposed to be a hero for heroes sake he isn t interesting or built up he is forced in for the sake of having a new character and mog there is a moogle for no reason that follows you around the game only barely gives a reason as to why he even is in the game this moogle is the most ear grating thing ever and represents everything western fans hate about jrpg voice acting mog is a mascot character through and through and his kupo will haunt me in my nightmares all these characters have no proper role in this entire story they exist for the sake of existing the gameplay got touched on but has the same essence as the first game note i said touched on and not improved the combat did become more fluid with less useless animations but the structure of battles has become much less strategic and much more reactionary the main strategy comes from building a party member most enemies in the game can be captured and then turned into a party member this can completely break the game depending on how you tackle this system if you end up not understanding the system because of how confusing it can be then you end up slogging through the fights if you even understand it a little bit you will end up stomping of the game until the final fights of the game which for some reason are a nightmare i could do every fight in the game nearly blindfolded with the same strategy but for some reason the final area required me to have practically extremely decked out characters even with me spending a bit of extra time on side content and grinding either way i was already starting to get bored with ff battle system towards the end of the first game by the end of this game i grew extremely tired of it also did time travel monster party member and new main character sound overly convoluted and confusing yes well you haven t heard the start of it this game doesn t have a proper vision of what it wants to be it just wants to be everything ff failed to be it tries to be extremely open ended but has to repeat a ton of content and messes up the games balance as a result it constantly throws random plot points and game mechanics at you to try and keep you interested there are puzzle sections that just feels forced the last area has a platforming section with timed jumps that are slow as hell it has a ton of side content which you can completely avoid if you want some of these are things that ff was lacking but overall the execution is horrible so many annoying things were cleaned up from ff that it feels mind boggling that so many other aspects were introduced and made so slow and boring there are a lot of ideas here but clearly not enough time budget to actually realize the complete vision for this game which is sad so much of this would have been really appreciated in ff especially some of the side content like a coliseum or the golden saucer style area that extra content is also one of the few positives i see in this game and it is what allows the ending to somewhat make sense somehow those who are fanatic about ff might be able to find something there in that bonus content maybe i could enjoy this stuff a lot better if the games port also wasn t one of the worst i have ever experienced i had to mess hours before even playing the game with mods to try and fix this mess and it still is so bad that its more common for it to be lagging and stuttering then for it to just run normally if you have any particle effect like rain or sand on screen you can say goodbye to your frames some people even reported corrupted saves which i thankfully didn t get overall this port is a joke and a spit in the face of the fans of the series every time you move between area you have to look at a loading screen for like minute this is unacceptable when you have to move between areas constantly especially if you want to do side quests even something as simple as achievements feel half backed and forced in with descriptions barely describing what you are supposed to do i hate this game but i think those who enjoy this game should be able to play it on pc without these horrible issues even if i enjoyed the game i think i would still not recommend this game purely due to how bad the port is and somehow maybe the worst thing for me is the story it turned the relatively straightforward story of ff into a mess all the themes and character build up of the first game feels like it was spit out in favor of the new cast of characters and what do these new characters and story line offer future heart kupo friends paradox chaos i miss the personal interactions between characters facing a difficult problem ff wasn t perfect but it did a lot right in creating some emotionally gripping scenes those scenes also exist here but they are extremely rare its sad to see because i actually can see a lot of potential in the story it is exciting to see where the world of ff was going after its ending but everything here just feels like a bad fan fiction more then anything else i downright hate this game with every fiber of my body it isn t only bad but it actively makes ff worse and i actually kind of liked that game to some extend this game wastes your time it runs like crap it is boring as hell for a game that tries to teach you so much about the value of time it is ridiculous that it has this much filler content that just straight up wastes your time i can t ever recommend this game even if you want to play all mainline ff games like me i would just recommend seeing a youtube summary or something and avoiding this i entered with not a lot of hope and left with a disgusting after taste somehow the only people i would ever recommend this to are those who completed ff and still somehow wanted more even to those i would give a warning to make sure you understand what you are

playing and the other on pc the latter of which i was successful in completing after a fair amount of forcing myself to keep going despite really liking ffxiii while still recognizing it has weaknesses for me it was plot holes and post game stuff i could not enjoy ffxiii during the great majority of my time playing it where to begin this is a port so let s talk about that first it runs terribly compared to ffxiii ffxiii ran like butter for me while was choppy and near unplayable on the same pc until i installed a user made fps capping app from the steam discussion page after that it was a little choppy still with character lip synching off by a few seconds but it was definitely playable the controls and everything else about the port were just dandy for me do not play this if you haven t completed ffxiii or at least watched all the cutscenes from ffxiii as it would be very confusing otherwise speaking of confusing villain s plan isn t described well enough to make total sense nor is much of the storyline with plot threads such as mog s origin and why people from a survival focused era when less than humans are left on the planet would wear stylish ornate colorful clothing in a barren wasteland fighting for their lives wanting to survive it would be like if rick and friends on the walking dead were decked out in bling bright blue parachute pants etc while being pursued by zombies the female lead in the game magically gets new clothing and there is no explanation as to why the female lead should ve just had a new outfit naturally since she s living in a full on civilization and the male lead could get the magical clothing to replace his rags but instead the writers chose to lack all logic with this decision now many humans can suddenly use magic whereas before it was only l cie that could do it i actually liked that plot point in ffxiii so i would have preferred that only l cie and ex l cie can use it because only one human in the entire game would need a writing modification to explain why that character can use magic only one changing the rules of the lore is just weird and unnecessary one major character from ffxiii becomes a l cie in but you never see it happen it doesn t seem to have any importance in the storyline and you never hear any resolution to it or see that character in the ending despite that character being one of the most important characters in the universe for one of the heroes also the ending of the game can be pretty aggravating upsetting disappointing i didn t upset me anywhere near as badly as mass effect ending but it s gotta be in my top most disappointing endings if i bothered to make such a list i didn t believe another reviewer who claimed that the ending would piss me off and i regret it that reviewer was absolutely right i honestly recommend that you just watch all the cinematics and cutscenes which you can watch spliced together on youtube it would ve saved me hours at least this game has a battle system which is almost completely identical to ffxiii s the only biggest differences are that battles are random with the player being able to slash the opponent to start with haste and part of the enemy s stagger bar filled oh and you use the male and female lead and a monster as your third party member you can use almost any monster in the game but each can only do one role in the paradigm system and you have to feed items to the monsters to level them up which ends up being a time suck if you want to make a really good monster much of the time my human characters were lords of war when i was in a fight while my monsters were just sucking badly this game was also much much easier than ffxiii for me as well and i m pretty awful at this kind of game the final boss was annoying but other than that i didn t even have to try on most of the bosses and i just set my team to all commandos for every non boss fight winning within seconds or less after about or so completing of the game s story this game might just have the worst experience scaling of any ff game i ve ever played because half way through fights were giving me xp and those encounters were nearly twice as frequent to pop up as the rest of the game s random battles which gave more like xp per fight the music was very similar to that of ffxiii with a few reused songs here and there and a few songs that i really disliked which probably would be classified as metal which isn t really my thing i liked the voice acting as well except for the villain who came off a bit too melodramatic for my taste there is a casino which sounded cool but the interesting sounding activities are locked off as dlc it s including but you can t use the dlc until you finish the game s entire main storyline and everything else either requires a lot of time chocobo racing which most players say is garbage compared to ffvii s or is all about randomness which is the slot machines to get items i wanted from the casino slots without wasting my life away i had to clamp down tab on my keyboard for hours and walk away while it autoplayed reloading my game if i didn t make money the casino in this game just wasn t fun for me last but not least this game does have a post game that s not really my bag but i did try to collect all of the fragments hidden objects in the game and got of of them i called it quits when i got about through the story and a quest giver basically tells your lulz the writers could ve written this in somehow within your first hour of playing so you could prepare and not have such a daunting task but screw you i need you to fight every type of monster in the entire game including weird fights that you do for choosing incorrect dialog options during the storyline etc and you will likely have to consult an online guide and spent countless hours to get my fragment but i m paraphrasing his lines from memory seriously what a jackass move and is it worth it getting all of the fragments at least half of my time at my computer with this game was spent getting fragments and all they do is give you some data files you could just look up online help you get the secret ending just watch it on youtube after you finish the game which makes a lot less sense than the original and still has the bad things happen that might anger you and boosts the stats of the two lead characters that stat boost though i had fragments which gave me higher attack attribute scores than i would have if i d used the next best weapons which were on sale at the normal stores for cheap my attack attribute was over so losing points just wouldn t have mattered except when going for post game optional bosses in summary the game has a pretty good soundtrack a competent battle system with a third party member that disappoints unless you re willing to put in a lot of time a so so story with an anger inducing ending a crappy casino hellish amounts of busy work to find all the fragments and a secret ending that s a complete let down even though i didn t do all the work to get it i cannot recommend this game but i would say that the hours it would take you to watch all the cutscenes and moviews from it in youtube would be worth your time if you believe me and other reviewers that the ending really does deliver a low blow and you were a big enough fan of ffxiii that you care to see what happens next though fal cie and l cie are rarely brought up and most ffxiii characters have very little screen time '],Not Recommended

you finally create or destroy is something entirely different but remarkably similar at the same time a creation of something new from ages past a relic to be used once more epitomizes such qualities in a manner that takes what their predecessor had previously done and made some in my eyes welcoming changes it should also be noted since the game is different from the first some things remain the same and since the game draws heavily from time traveling expect lots of questions and eyebrow raising as well no more will players be restricted to one path throughout the game like the previous areas are more fleshed out with quests involving a lot of back tracking in order to complete them in order to earn cp crystogen points which is used to upgrade your characters in the crystarium players who played the previous installment will remember this as their go to way to leveling up their character usually by battling to accrue cp or exp or doing side quests to earn more cp and unlock fragments and oh boy fragments and artifacts you will hear this in the story a lot being heard basically in it s most basic form their a plot device that you need to progress through the story using the items above one can traverse through time in different eras called af after the fall from don t be alarmed though the game doesn t make it like after etc you will only visit relative and important eras spanning different areas to explore an interesting twist with time travel is the addition of paradoxes and alternate timelines which the game heavily abuses to see different areas dramatically change in setting and thus irrevocably change the power to reverse such paradoxes is up to you mainly but i found the different eras in different places pleasing and a welcome change exploration has been revamped coinciding with side quests so expect a lot of backtracking to either farm for cp materials and even a chance of taming a creature whereas before you can only go forward in the story for the first game here you can keep going back and restart eras to replay the events prior to see it all again hell there s even a casino area and chocobo racing which i felt was rigged against me or i just suck badly a new mechanic reminiscent of capturing pok mon or digimon upon battles you have a chance to tame the creature you are facing these creatures range from smallest to large creatures you primarily face in the ffxiii universe of course each creature you tame can also be infused and made stronger using another creature to boost their capabilities if their compatible enhancing their role adding new abilities or even adding resistances they can also be leveled up using items compatible for them different from cp using items like potent chip potent slivers etc these items can be bought from shops or earned as drops from battles to enhance your creature quickly eliminating the need to grind them each item is different and can be used to upgrade their hp only their magic only or both some creatures are unique and can be tamed enabling strong party members while others you can t tame like bosses for instance or some creatures like c eith the battle system remains the same with paradigms and roles commando ravager sentinel medic saboteur and synergist however with the new creature mechanic you can expect a lot of new experimentation to create your own team that suits you coupled with the creature taming it provides a diverse and fun way to hunt for new companions to suit your battles and become stronger fan of the old will immediately be familiar with the same battle mechanic with the same o l atb rate but this time you can unlock your roles via crystarium and unlock more atb charges and boost your roles upon completing a round in the crystarium it pleasant needing no introduction to the battle system with several new additions to the system with taming story wise with time travel usually gives me headaches to understand the convoluted sense of the story but in this game they don t make it overtly complicated raising the right questions that will sooner or later be understood in the progressing story what really changes the story up are the dialogue options during events only four choices to depend on what you will say and these events will pop up again and again to inform the player of important events i m guessing it all lodges back into paradox endings you can achieve quick time events are included with this sequel in order to gauge player choice usually within a cinematic event you are prompted with qte to progress through the story completing them rewards items while not completing them makes you restart the whole progress and while it can be annoying to wait for the button prompts the events were short and not so much that it was intrusive and bothersome some qte are unique in providing a choice of a certain different path to take than a usual previous route you play as serah the sister to lightning from the previous game in a race against time really to solve paradoxes with the adorable mog which you can torture by throwing to various places to pick up items and reveal hidden items in the world but wait there s more a future guy also travelled back in time to help you because you need a partner his name is noel and you in essence share the leader role with him meaning you can switch from running around the world as noel or serah or face battles as noel or serah while it sucks i can t change them to be just creature parties i found the cast to be likable and sympathetic to their cause to save time and reach lightning in valhalla in true final fantasy fashion you can even customize your creatures and outfit serah and noel in different attire moogle too and guess what even your creatures can have certain adornments on them you find in the game or buy music and battle themes some may remember some old sound tracks which fit the times you are exploring providing a soothing comfort and others new provide the tension to keep your body tense reading to spring into action to compare versus its predecessor is like comparing a baby to a child the changes in the game make it very diverse from exploration and taming battling and side quests and dialogue options and more it takes the criticisms of the first installment and in my opinion improves it to make it better for the player to enjoy while it may seem drastic to add many new mechanics and along with a new protagonist represents a bold risk that ultimately paid off total times beaten is based off how much i enjoyed the game date reviewed posted

the graphical capabilities of this game on the pc are untrue it runs slower than sometimes dropping quite low in more intense battles larger view battles this is nota fault of anyone s pc but how the game was programmed with the in mind a poor architecture it does not make use of the full capabilities of gpus or multi core cpus therefore it will run similarly on older computers as it might on a state of the art the software is the limit not the hardware that said i do have an older pc i played in a window at that resolution using the smallest shadow map and mpaa it ran alright for the most part as i said it had it s slow moments but was hardly unplayable as some might have suggested i do play modern games at post but do not find low fps to be a kill all i could probably have upped the shadow and aa and still been fine no crashes no critical flaws to the game in that regard i could have been lucky but that was my experience now then on to the game review itself would i recommend this game yes the story i find rather touching if a little too sappy at times i don t find it really killed the story of the first but rather fleshes it out the combat remains quite close to final fantasy which is a plus albiet there are times when i felt it was overly easy comparatively explained later the time traveling and gate closing mechanics give you chances to go back and redo areas to complete them differently where available unlike final fantasy you do not need to replay the game through from the start multiple times to see everything you will need to replay sections but so far nothing i have seen too much repeating the world is definitely more open than it was in the first game there is more to explore than narrow hallways still very closed in spaces comapred to world maps in the older games but better now for the things i did not care for ease of battles battling in seemed a bit more tactical than it is in i attribute this to the libra spell which you could cast at will in the first game in this game there are librascopes you can find or buy for exorbitant prices about mid game but no actual simple libra spell to get data on monsters initially this means the game can t be too harsh for not paying complete attention to the monsters while you fight them without foreknowledge of the enemies you just have to constantly hit them until information is revealed often through multiple encounters if you don t avoid fighting a long way through the game most your random battles until the very end will revolve around three commandos just nuking everything with blitz and ruinga auto battle will be used overall as very rarely do you need to worry about selecting proper skills not to say that there are no times it s better to manually control especially if less than ideally leveled but mostly that revolved around me applying proper debuffs to certain enemies in that regard though i felt a lot of the battles could just be brute forced compared to with only a few that it really mattered to focus on it all many times if you didn t care about time too much having a strong sentinal member not too hard to get early on and upgrade later could really ease it speaking of character classes the wheel as it were of your party member rather than a single character with multiple classes you capture and raise various monsters for the roles each monster only has a single role and you can only have equipped monsters at a time to fill various roles for the most part this isn t a big deal raising them isn t too specifric unless you need uber monsters to help the uber enemies situation even then i don t see the value in perfectly upgraded partners and speaking up upgrades the crysterium is very lack luster to me compared to the first game i liked how you could choose which class to level in what order in the first game but each character would ultimately max out at a certain stat level when all was finished in the first game you had a max level for a given area which forced more strategy on the player as they could no brute force it as much this game regular battles are basically infinite cp batteries you will be maxed well before the end of the game unless you really rush how you level though is is a single crysterium for all classes on each character depending which class you level though at different points in the crysterium including even odd levels on some classes gives different bonus stats in short there is an ideal way of leveling each character while others could leave you with somewhat less than great stats depending which all you leveled nothing game breaking but if you are a perfectionist prepare to study and research ideal leveling order lastly a few of the fragments in the game are a real time sink and pain to get grinding certain enemies to get a lot of gil to just dump at one point taping a button on the controller down on the slot machines just to make sure i win a certain amount over a few hourts while i browsed the web battling every enemy at least once including rare enemies and some that have a chance of not spawning at all on a run through an area before you have to reset the area and try again

s also the only direct sequel in the franchise that really had to improve upon what came before and despite a short development time of only actually managed to partially fix what many disliked about its predecessor miraculously first of doesn t fix what isn t broken the great atb battle system from makes a return which means that stagger bars paradigm shifts and the crystarium are back again there have been some adjustments however as drew criticism for only opening up its battle system late into the game now most jobs are available from the beginning and as core abilities are unlocked quickly character development and stats can be influenced by the player from the start another change concerns the party system as only features two protagonists there s a third character slot that needs to be filled during battle this can be done by taming certain enemies after fighting them in the wild this might sound like but in praxis it s even more simple than that a monster only one per species might join your party after battle which is simply based on chance and while monsters can be levelled by infusing them with certain items their job as well as their passive active abilities are predetermined only their stats as well as their looks can be slightly influenced by the player but even if the monster system is somewhat simple it allows for easy and quick party customization want your protagonists to focus on certain jobs in the beginning simply swap in a fitting monster for the jobs you might only want to level later all monsters also got special empathy abilities which can be triggered after a certain time which can range from attack with decent manage to very useful party wide heals the only downside to the monster system might be the additional time investments to gather the right materials in order to fully boost them to their max level another common complaint about concerns linearity as there were many straight corridors and very few open areas to explore this has also been addressed by which consists of many open areas although most of them are on the smaller side think though the similarities don t end there in both games areas can only be accessed by selecting them from a map in a central hub which means the world doesn t feel as connected coherent as the ones in or for example also offers less interesting locations compared to but is about the same visual quality otherwise which is hardly surprising since many assets are reused the soundtrack is quite varied this time around which might fit the difference of the individual locations but doesn t really seem coherent in the bigger picture additionally there are a few moments where the music choice feels ill fitting which is extremely rare for a title as with the pc port of is of very poor quality again this does include console exclusive dlc this time around visit for fan made fixes if you really want to play this game one day the focus of the remaining review concerns the central theme of time travelling in terms of gameplay it s mainly used to restrict the available locations want to access a certain timeline for the next story segments find the right items artifacts to do so want to gather all available collectibles fragments manipulate the time of certain locations via artifacts though a time travel element during battles exploration would ve been interesting time travel is only used to alter entire locations e g visit the same place years in the future the real problem of introducing time travel and the main problem of as a whole is the influence time travelling has on the story time travel stories are very hard to pull off and can quickly turn into a narrative mess as the audience needs to be properly guided through a labyrinth of similar but different timelines since time travel could potentially change about every action character or location in the story it s very important to make sure that the audience can follow what you re trying to tell them needless to say that doesn t manage to do that already struggled with its mythos and storytelling adding time travelling to the mix would certainly not help to clear things up for one thing while does requires lore knowledge of its predecessor it also feels strangely disconnected as it s focusing on entirely different aspects and foes of the world while the cast of the original game returns in very limited capacity expect for previous protagonist lightning the story mostly focuses on the sister of lightning serah as well as the last human of future earth noel thanks to elements that weren t even hinted at during the previous game serah and noel need to time travel in order to achieve a certain proper timeline while going against a new one dimensional and uninteresting villain the resulting story is simply a mess which is not very surprising but not exactly what i hoped for either serah and noel are a step up from the protagonists of but they re not going to leave a lasting impression either and considering there are only very few characters present in the story that s saying something it s also quite easy to get lost in what happens in which timeline and why especially if you re taking longer breaks between game sessions the basic story might be downright predictable but it s the poorly explained surrounding elements including the time travelling itself that can cause confusion some side stories with important information once sold as dlc on console are also only unlocked once the story has been completed it also has to be mentioned that once again many important lore bits are hidden in datalog text entries they re even worse to unlock this time around however as you re required to find the corresponding fragments hidden in the game world if you want to read them there are of them all of which are required for the secret ending finally it doesn t help that the uneven story of ends on an unsatisfying cliffhanger and a literal to be continued screen even as the middle part of a trilogy this cliffhanger comes off so abruptly forced it really makes you wonder why you even bothered playing through the story of to begin with it s gameplay might be fine but the messy

game a lot more than the original if you want to read my review for the original xiii time for pros and cons the game is no longer a long corridor the areas are open with things to be discovered and time travel gives a good excuse to see many diverse and interesting locations there is a nice amount of different locations and some areas are the same location but in a different time period good music overall and some tracks are superb like these the narrative is very focused compared to the muddled mess in the original this is mostly thanks to there only being a handful of main characters the villian is great you completely understand why he is doing the things he does the combat is a lot better this time around while still feeling like the same system when you changed your partys roles in the orignal game there was a animation that took you out of the battle for about seconds this might not seem like a big deal but removing this animation and just letting the battle flow like it was before does a lot to improve the pacing of fights in this game if the character you are controlling dies you just take control of the other person in your party this was lacking in the original game and it is very nice to see them address this problem you can also change what character you are controlling mid battle a very welcome addition the leveling system is actually very open to customization compared to the linear mess in the original if you want to you could go through the entire game without ever getting the ability to heal not that i would reccomend it but it s awesome that you can do that you have characters that are stuck in your party and a third slot open for a monster that you have tamed you can tame most of the monsters in the game and every monster has its own abilites and base stats i say base stats because you could have behemoth monsters but level them up completely differently you can also find a lot of cosmetic items for the monsters including hats each monster also has a unique limit break ability there is loads of optional content through the story you will be collecting fragments to unlock new locations and time periods you get these items by doing side quests and just finding them in chests when i finished the game i only had out of so if you want to you could spend a lot of time with this game this time around they included some actual graphics options including resolution msaa up to and shadow resolution the game can run at fps but there is dual audio i played it in english and everyone was fine except for lightning she has less peronality than microsoft sam good thing lightning only has about minutes of screentime in the entire game weapon system is better than in the original in the original you could upgrade your weapons meaning that if you just kept upgrading your original weapon you had no reason to ever buy a new one and because of the effort and gil needed to upgrade a single weapon you literally had no reason to ever get a new weapon in this one you get access to new weapons in the shop the further you progress in the game some are just a straight up upgrade stat wise anyway but other weapons have special abilites stuck to them but these require some additional items aswell as gil to be bought all in all it s a straightforward system but at least it works unlike the original game leads nicely into travel elements are very it s magic i ain t got to explain but then the characters waste a lot of time in cutscenes talking about how it works and it just ends up wasting time the combat is still very much a case of just switching your classes to match the situation and pressing the auto button there was only one time in the game where i actually selected commands and that was because i was against an enemy that had health regen but my character refused to cast poison with auto you can t control your characters in battles this can be really annoying in a lot of different sittuations like when you have somebody as a tank with the ability to divert enemy attention to themselves and the party just stands around really close to each other as a result everyone gets hit regardless this defeats the entire purpose of a system that works in a space story was okay at best but a lot of time was wasted on nonsensical time travel and in the end it just came down to x thing is a paradox we must kill fix it x often being just a random boss enemy in the area the story was more interesting when it focused on the stories of ciaus yuel serah and noel the game has very unstable framerate i never dropped under though nonetheless it can be very annoying to watch as the framerate jumps all over the place the game crashed at least once every hours the biggest time lost as a result was hour regardless this was very annoying and by doing a short google search i can see that i am not the only one with this issue this time around there are minigames something lacking from the original but all of them are luck based and some are even locked behind dlc i must admit i wasn t excpecting much out of this game but all the non linearity and freedom came as a big surprise with loads of optional content much improved combat system and non linearity in almost every aspect this game is actually worth playing unlike the original as long as you are fine with a combat system that is very

game most of the fights will be much easier to the point that most of the times i just had to press a a few times with relentless attack being selected as the default paradigm even most of the boss fights were made fairly forgiving that doesn t mean there are not some hard battles but they generally happen in the side content and not in the main gamepath just as in ffxiii you control only the party leader the other two members will act autonomously according to their role this time there is only a cast of main characters serah and noel during most of the game you can set freely who is the party leader so you can have either a female or a male character leading the party around instead of a supporting staff there will be monsters fighting along these two these monsters are captured randomly during fights and can be leveled up with the right type of materials also they can be infused into each other gaining the passive abilities and a level based number of class specific abilities eventually i just used the early peaker types of monsters to get access to high health and infusing the missing skills from other partially leveled monsters the fighting styles are bundled into paradigms where you can set up only up to six to switch between the available paradigms are further limited by the fact that only monster types can be used out of possible role types the only really important monster roles are the sentinel for tanking and ravager for chain bonus building till the midgame a medic was handy but eventually the main cast will level up as makeshift medics too the only other monster that i used was a commando meaning that i skipped on the saboteurs and synergists i leveled up such monsters but because only monsters can be used in a setup i stuck to rav sen med eventually replacing the med with a com leveling the main characters is extremely straightforward you select a role and linearly progress along it the still unlockable skills are listed at the lower right with the level when they unlock by the end of the game i had the main skill at the max level happened around the third of the game and practically all the other roles had all of their available abilities unlocked there is an easy mode in the game but i didn t feel the need to switch to it at any time that meant that the final boss battle lasted well over half an hour since i was defensive enough to survive recover from partial wipes but lacked the offensive power to do high damage in a short amount of time it didn t help that the supporting enemies were continuously resummoned forcing me to kill them again and again as far as i know there is no hard mode the progression through the story is extremely contorted you have to unlock random things on different maps to progress on however there is no guidance whatsoever as to where to go next nodes with still darked out gates or with lot of fragments remaining are a good guess to explore further but you might end at a gate that requires a random fragment that must be unlocked at an unspecified place side quest even when i knew what to search for on the internet finding out the correct route was a matter of lucking out on the search results of all the games that i have played this had the most obtuse online guidance help if you don t follow a full walkthrough guide right from the start and i didn t do that at any point expect a lot of hindrances to progression even the side quests are not highlighted in any way you literally have to talk to everyone hoping to start a side quest instead of getting a random bit of trivia when you do get a side quest there will be a hint image showing the completion location if that image seems entirely unfamiliar it means that it is in a place you haven t traveled yet and of course with no help whatsoever how to get there some maps can be accessed through a special key item the wild artifact as far as i can tell all of those maps are optional you can reach the ending without touching them you get at least one of these artifacts for free on the map i got one as a side quest reward and as a last resort they can be bought for coins in the casino and since money can be freely traded for coins at worst you can buy such a wild artifact for gil don t expect to have the map fully unlocked just by playing through the main game path beside the wild artifact maps there will be some paradox ending maps which i assume can be accessed after finishing the main story line as such having a lot of undiscovered nodes on the map is normal for a simple playthrough through the main storyline most of the times you will encounter enemies through them randomly spawning out of thin air on you in the map i remember only one map with roaming enemies but even there were enemies randomly spawning there is an option of running away from random spawns but that works only if there is enough space to distance yourself from them and they don t have fast units generally there will be no such units also there is a bonus if you can engage an enemy by pressing a instead of being attacked by it or running accidentally into it which is very easy as they spawn out of thin air as you run and in confined spaces its almost guaranteed that you run into them should you fail an encounter after the game over screen you get a retry option starting just before the encounter i didn t know for a long time but the save button can be used to force a retry even before the actual defeat there are a variety of logical puzzles to solve but one kind of them is quite though it is the clock puzzle where the problem is exacerbated by the fact that you don t even know the right starting point and eventually with possible starting points there can be a lot of trials that are doomed from the start i eventually used an online solver you can buy better equipment at the various store points sprinkled througout the game some of them require special components to farm i abstained from selling random junk because i didn t know what would be a useful upgrade component in a hindsight i could have sold everything even the money only weapons should be sufficient just in case you can buy such money only weapons before the final boss fights the graphics of the game were gorgeous but that was partially because i used a texture mod which pushed the graphics to the limits of the engine it already had to keep some texture in the original state to fit into the memory limit the music was good but a lot of it seemed familiar from ffxiii the japanese voice acting was good too as always when there is a choice for native japanese voice acting i used that this time there wasn t text only npcs like in earlier games everything will be spoken out there is manual save in the game and out of combat cut scenes you can save freely as far as i know there is no auto save so always save manually before exiting the game also i used only a single save slot though there might be more the game can be played with keyboard mouse or with a gamepad i naturally used a gamepad the native system intended for the game ironically you can exit the game only with the keyboard either esc enter or as there is no such menu option the game starts with keyboard prompts even if you use a controller be sure to change to controller prompts prior to new game as during the intro part i couldn t figure out how to change that and got keyboard prompts for quick time events even playing with a controller i installed the hd texture mod from nexusmods and which i think is a must for mode the

with slightly different mechanics from chapter to chapter tl dr version game is bad don t buy it don t rent it and wait for a very deep sale but only if you re a completionist of final fantasy games also the pc port quality is horrendous for and less so for lightning returns let s make it quick and dirty shall we i m a big fan of jrpgs and of the ff series in general and i have to say that this game is bad it pains me to admit it but after playing the first games and of the third i had to force myself and rush to the ending of lightning returns just for the sake of ticking the damn box and getting over with it i definitely could not bother with new game the most egregious fault by square enix was to try and shoehorn an abomination of hybrid action combat system in place of the traditional atb based or turn based system of the previous chapters with the aggravating factor that you mostly control only character at any time while the other in the party are controlled by the ai and just follow generic patterns if they are ever present at all see below with frustrating results the second and absolutely horrendous decision was to dramatically reduce the number of spells and actions that each character could theoretically execute in battle because console controllers have only four buttons to mash amirite guyses did anyone ever mention these weird things called scrolling menus forget the classic attack magic item summon skill whatever list you now have either a variation of mash a to auto select skills or press a for slash b for fire x for cure y for potion that s it and trust me it is even worse in the first two games since you only choose the classes jobs you characters are and then the fight basically plays by itself on auto but hey at least ff games have epic stories with strong characters many plot twists and memorable villains right right wronghere is a summary of the that is this trilogy spoiler safe the first chapter of the trilogy is definitely the worst considering also the overly long development time it is a glorified tutorial at best and the player is forced through long linear corridor map sections with absolutely no clue of what is going on without being given even a small hint to understand the plot of the game for hours and hours sometimes the player controls character sometimes a different couple sometimes completely different guys with the only task to move from one mob group to the other from one cutscene to the next oh and there is no character advancement system whatsoever up to at least mid game because who needs it in an rpg that s preposterous the most insulting thing of them all once the corridors end and the first true open area is reached when you are finally given the option to rearrange your party and properly equip it the final mission starts and the effin game ends i had to read a walkthrough guide to be sure that i did not skip most of the game by accident by entering the final dungeon prematurely la chrono trigger sadly i did not make any mistake the game was really over at that point take the convoluted and obscure plot of the chapter throw time travel paradoxes in remove all the characters you barely knew from add the most annoying protagonist teen couple ever in the mix and reduce the max number of party members down to and you still get a better game than ff seriously they could have done worse only if square was so lazy to recycle most of the assets again and again from the game on every map oh wait they actually did it ff is basically just an asset flip of xiii but hey you can collect pok mon in this game isn t it cool also the character advancement system in yes square remembered to add one since the beginning this time is the worst thing i have experienced in any rpg ever you need several external guides just to get a grasp of it since it is that badly documented in game it would have been better if square simply did like in the chapter or forget to implement it at all i must admit this is the most solid game of the trilogy or at least the most solid turd of the on the positive side this time the plot is explained to the player somehow the efforts put in to fix the

maintaining it s core principles and mechanics gameplay is an improved version of paradigm atb combat you still have the same roles com rav sab syn med sen and the same maximum of members in your party except now you have the ability to get rare drops from almost everything you fight excluding bosses that allow you to use said monster for your party member this really opens up that much needed flexibility compared to where all party members were essentially the same apart from their full atb skill also important to note is that there s no longer a long animation for paradigm shifting which really feels more natural and doesn t make your characters idle for a few seconds wasting that precious time you could be using to input commands characters feel less clunky and slow in their animations and you get the full combat system available very early on into the story one of the main gripes i had with was that you were forced into the slow progression into unlocking the full capabilities of the paradigm shifting system other than the reasonable improvements it s still essentially combat mechanics you still craft higher tier weapons with monster materials although it s less farmy compared to accessories take a major backseat due to a limitation being placed on the amount of accessories you can hold on one character which different accessories having different amounts of capacity they take up eidolons summons are gone but it s not really missed since you d barely use them in anyway you also get fragment skills which are unlocked as you go along completing the game these have a wide range of effects from changing monster encounter rates to opening up different endings by allowing an alternative path the world itself has been really revamped though you can now jump although you re often blocked with invisible walls in most places and as a result there s a lot more verticality in the map design you aren t forced into a corridor driving you forward towards the story progression is done by visiting areas of varying sizes some small some very large in different time periods you ll often have the option of visiting a place multiple times in different time periods but it s not repetitive due to the slightly altered designs and different npcs still has that gorgeous visual quality from the level design really has an emphasis on creating the perfect atmosphere for the situation it s amazing how well they managed to convey each time period of the same location so uniquely the story s done much better with excellent pacing that feels natural and not forced you unlock new locations and time periods of that said location within a level and progress slowly along with the story although the locations have barely any correlation with each other the story itself is actually done well characters feel natural and likable and the main antagonist is one of the best final fantasy villians in recent memory pacing is done well since you control where and when to go and it s fairly open it feels more like you re just going around places solving time paradoxes and moving onto the next world which is a really nice change from forced pacing there s plenty of optional areas to visit during the story and the hub historia crux allows you to visit past areas instantly without having to retrace your steps sonically this is personally one of my favourites from the recent ff games there s tracks remixed tracks and new music that really helps set the tone of the game there s beautiful orchestral tracks well written vocals and context appropriate background music that help drive the atmosphere of each and every situation although i felt there were a bit too many vocals and it was definite far more than what s usually present in a ff game not that i m complaining though some of the vocal tracks are done perfectly naoshi mizuta outdoes herself in noel s theme which features hauntingly sombre vocals with a simple piano and violin background the song really encompasses the character noel and his struggles and it s used to really emphasise emotional scenes the main battle theme paradigm shift is a fast paced track featuring a vibrant violin a simple but strong drum beat and a bassy synth it really suits the frantic but orderly nature of battles and it s colourful but subdued enough to help focus on the battle eclipse is another standout with vocals acting as a backing to the sharp violins frantic pianos and punchy bassline honestly even if my terrible adjectives haven t convinced you at least listen to the soundtrack it s really good as a pc port it s bad not bad but still pretty bad it has graphical options for resolution anti aliasing and shadow resolutions but nothing else and it s not even ingame but within a window that acts as a launcher of sorts the is still here with it s warning box that s still a popup box outside of the game it s but poorly optimised so you can expect sudden drops in certain areas graphically it s stunning but with few options to tinker around with there hasn t been any bugs i ve noticed though compared to which suffered from random crashes that forced you to save at every available opportunity as pc ports go square enix still has a long way to go all in all it s a good game with great visuals an interesting time travel based story with an optimised combat system from

1023,Tatsuhoshi,65.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mishka_Precious/,"December 18, 2014",9,['there seems to be a lot of hate for this game stemming from largely unimportant technical issues versus actual game quality so let me give my two cents as an avid gamer with a very diverse array of games and technical knowledge let me start off by saying that this is a console to pc port while this game as all games are have been developed on a pc it was developed originally for an entirely different type of hardware so you can t just take your pc dev source and throw that on a computer and call it a day while there are some technical issues they are largely minor and unnoticeable with a few exceptions i ll cover all of that in detail below gameplay this game uses a similar combat system to its predecessor ffxiii in that rather than micromanaging every move of your team they learn from their combat experience and adjust their fighting on their own you simply tell them what role to fill in the party by changing your party paradigms while this means a whole lot less button pushing and decision making as far as battles go it makes for a more casual gameplay experience and allows battles to be conducted in real time for those of you that still want the final say in what is done how and where to what you can select the abilities individually through the combat menus i don t suggest doing this on boss fights as a note the game is split between exploring maps battling monsters and dialogue as far as the story goes they have a lot of interesting bits there is a solid story to be told and you are fed it through a myriad of time jumps and side quests you could of course straightline the story and be done with the game in a few hours but you d be missing out on a lot of the depth of the story and information take the time to explore the world do the side quests and you will be rewarded for the experience with a rich plot that is severely downplayed in reviews once serah grows a spine and takes up sword and bow for her sister s sake she s a certifiable badass and something new from the previous game you actually have a say in the stories deciding what she says or asks at critical points to affect the information and reactions of the npcs the party mechanics are pretty different now serah and noel are your only real party members and you can swap between which of them leads freely the third party slot is filled by tamed monsters each which has a specific role and can be evolved along the crystarium at the cost of item drops this mechanic is a bit odd but not unwelcomed there s a lot to be said for a behemoth mowing down your enemies along side the mains there are some battles where the characters from the first game assist such as a battle alongside snow fairly early on but i wish there would have been some of that for some of the newer npcs like alyssa who you run into repeatedly and even voices an interest in the party s actions and time travel controls don t use mouse and keyboard sure they work and they will get you through some stuff but they are a bit awkward and clunky the convenience of a controller is that all the controls for the game are easily accessible and don t require reaching across your keyboard and hitting the wrong button during a crucial moment or simply losing track of where your fingers are on the keyboard i am very accustomed to keyboard mouse controls get a controller it will make your life easier and many games benefit from the ease of access of the buttons you need in your hand audio i applaud squeenix for this whole heartedly for those of you who like the english voice cast which they did do an amazing job of casting i might add the game offers the usual english release as seen on the consoles for those of you who prefer to hear the original voices you can choose the original voice track from the japanese version of the game if you know japanese you ll here some inconsistencies between the dialogue and the subtitles that are curious but for the most part both are solid and you won t miss anything one way or the other the music for this game is very easy to listen to though the battle theme is repetitive and a bit obnoxious at times especially as frequently as you end up in battles the rest of the soundtrack during exploration is beautiful and well done rather than simply extending the soundtrack a little from the previous game there are only a few familiar songs from xiii and most of the music for is new nice vocals sung in english for the most part help add to the story as the songs are actually relevant to the plot in their weirdly engrish way i wish the soundtrack was available for this on steam as well graphics here s the bit where things get dicey the game is fantastically beautiful and well worth exploring that said the game s requirements are fairly punishing on most middleweight moderate systems the game runs beautifully on my desktop amd quad core ram crossfired with no measurable issues all those people complaining about frame rates dropping to unplayable levels are either experiencing hardware incompatibility issues or other os related issues such as background processes viruses and malware or everyone s friend system idle process or are simply first worlders with no real concept of what unplayable is and are just whining for attention and because things aren t perfect for them nothing is going to be perfect and this title is no exception to that rule it is playable my laptop struggles a bit more with the game on the other hand but the issues are so minor that i still have no real unplayable moments the game engine is built with an internal frame skipping mechanic that mitigates lower end systems something i don t think many people have noticed while the game may not be running per second it does it s best to keep it as close to as it can i have no complaints with this even when the count drops below this the game is still playing smoothly thanks to the frame skipping with only a little bit of lag during the visually stunning spells like thundaga and ruinga it s running a amd quad core ram and video card in conclusion this game is worth the money at its not like squeenix is trying to milk a new market plus we get most of the dlc at no additional cost the only thing that they could have thrown in to make it a better deal would have been the soundtrack sure the game may occasionally drop in performance a little bit at times but it s never bad enough that the game can t be played and the gameplay experience is not bad i m playing final fantasy on my computer and i m very happy for the experience as a side note i do own both games on consoles so i am aware of how they play there i can t pack up my console and

of going from one map to another in a linear fashion you go from one map to another then back to the first map but at a different time the story progress is still set on a strict path so when you really think about it the game is linear but with maps repeating themselves times which is brilliant if you look at it from the development side of things from the player s perspective it s not too bad considering you can leave a map at any time and load another to finish up a sidequest or grind some cp for levels as for the story you can hate it or love it but it s a separate matter if you can understand it having played through the game and done all the sidequests i still don t know if i understood it or not i didn t bother much with the dlc it seemed pointless you either play texas hold em as sazh in a casino or do some vs grinding with lightning the arena is nice if you want a real challenge i ll briefly mention what i liked about this game the music alright now that that s out of the way let s talk about the characters and dialogue i just can t stand that every other sentence these teenagers blabber out is supposed to sound deep and perhaps they can if you re high enough the topics the main characters dabble in are philosophy motivational poster quotes and moral high ground with your usual anime tropes as filler something about needing to protect certain individuals and defeat the level design there are some really weird and archaic design choices made all with the sole purpose of wasting your time i ll bring up some very specific examples like the entirety of augusta tower not fun not challenging very annoying the weather control device in archylte steppe there are weather modes that you can switch between by using levers you need to set the lever combination up or down for specific weather which then triggers a second unskippable cutscene and unless you re a speedrunner you will not have memorized the combinations so you try again hope for the best and look at the damn cutscene again why not simply give me a selection of the weather modes with the currently active one being a different colour it doesn t take me out of the game and most importantly it doesn t waste my time the slow giant rock critter ride in sunleth waterscape was okay the first couple of times but after the third time i despised it the escalators in academia the ones that go in the opposite direction so you either bunny hop through it or interact with a lever for a couple of seconds to switch directions just why last map has the tetris block barges you stand and wait on a platform ledge for the block to turn towards you you get on the block and wait for it to turn towards the next platform you move to that platform and you do it again and again and again the devs must ve really thought the environment visuals were simply too good not to force the player to enjoy them i think on this map you spend more time waiting than doing anything else and that includes the encounters and the best part about this map is that you get to redo it from the start if you want to gather all the fragments because of the bestiary character progression did you know that levelling commando on a big crystal gives bonus strength and levelling ravager on a big crystal gives bonus magic what about the fact that if you level synergist to an odd level e g from to on a big crystal you ll get bonus magic and the best one is of course levelling saboteur even level on big crystal gives bonus strength and odd gives bonus magic the maximum level for each role is so if you waste too many levels of the above roles on small crystals you ll make your characters much weaker than if you d meticulously followed the rules and you cannot reset the crystarium i personally didn t notice these rules being mentioned in the game so you d need to pay close attention to know monster breeder the unit on your side in a battle is a monster that you capture not that i mind the fact that you can breed monsters to become better than either of your main characters but you d need to do quite a bit of research and experimentation to know how what and when to fuse monsters together to get the best passive abilities aside from fusing monsters together the monsters have their own crystarium which is a bit different they use items instead of cp which means grinding for items here s an example of how to get one of the most powerful ravagers in the game a blue chocobo first you need to catch one and a blue chocobo is a rare pokemon so getting it to even spawn without the battlemania fragment skill can take some time next up you need to get lucky to actually catch it there s another fragment skill that can help with that but rng is rng because it s a ravager role you ll want to boost its magic which means leveling the crystarium with mostly mana type materials for levels i used potent materials the rest all mana you ll need to level it to at least which is good because getting mana crystals is a pain so much so that i stopped levelling the bird after level since it s asking for crystals per level and i can t be bothered anymore it didn t really matter i still beat the final boss in minutes instead of the target time of minutes got it levelled up to great now all you need to do is just capture other monsters a few of which are rare one of which only exist on a map and you ll need two of them so better save before battle and reload if capture fails then close the gate and redo some story parts to get the second one level up these monsters as well until specific abilities become available then infuse them in the correct order and you re done i understand why some people would enjoy this process not me though granted creating the most overpowered critter isn t required to beat the the good old japanese grind for because sometimes it s not the skill that matters but how much time you re willing to give obviously playing of a game is optional and i definitely would ve hated the game less if i had not decided to go for it but here we are it s mostly about fragments and you ll actually want quite a lot of them to unlock certain fragment skills i ll just mention a few good examples of the grind captain cryptic quiz in academia getting a question wrong will make him disappear and reappear in one of the possible locations so you ll need to search around this annoying map once you get all the questions correct you ll get a fragment and now you get to do it four more times i think nobody would find this fun but this is the way of the japanese grind the monster professor fragment which requires you to completely fill out the bestiary will require you to have finished the game and gotten most of the paradox endings to finally complete it needless to say it was the last one i completed what s so bad about filling the bestiary for example did you know that a cactuar enemy can use an ability to change into a giant cactuar during a fight in fact that s the only way to encounter a giant cactuar considering it takes a long time until it uses the ability you ll have beaten the cactuar way before it does it how would you know to wait for cactuar to morph into giant cactuar without looking it up on the internet i have no clue how would you know where to find the missing monsters actually nevermind how would you even know which monsters you re missing from your list without looking it up on the internet i have no clue once again i suppose you d just go map by map and try to spawn all the monsters until you thought you had them all '],Not Recommended

them just search up the pcgaming wiki for solutions even after applying the mods the game continues to crash i did not like this game after spending more than hours and a will to continue to it at sometime in the future i would not recommend this game to anyone i m honestly appalled at those reviews that state that this is one of their favorite final fantasy games to each their own but i found there to be only one real moment of heart and emotion i felt for the characters and events that unfolded i don t know if i ve matured to some degree or if the japanese style writing has gone downhill so much i watch japanese movies occasionally and they still come off great every now and then japanese game writing though death stranding and the kingdom hearts series in general have no sense of real human emotion everyone comes off as an atypical anime action hero they feel sad when the story insists it upon them to they are happy just to get the other character happy lets tell the viewer why they are sad and when they bond they ll just tell each other they are has only two main characters and they some how develop them less than the of the previous effort we spend time jumping back and forth through timelines while the narrator discusses the perils of defying fate the main villain seems to note defying fate is wrong while defying fate itself while the game is not the hallway that ffxiii is it still is rather limited you get to go to different world meet up with old friend you never stay in an area long enough to get a connection you travel time to see who its like in the past and future but nothing like on the scale of link to the past or even ocarina each era is basically nailed down to as a mario level lets do this objective to get a star move on to next level there isn t any moment of urgency we do what we do to fix the timeline and find lightning we know at the beginning we are not fixing the time cause the narrator tell the audience we are in the wrong lightning is a god like being who can see the future so there is literally nothing that i can empathize with her as well she tells us what will happen in the story too noel sorta has an arc but thats it caius and serah don t do much really in evolution i ve been a fan of the final fantasy and squaresoft enix rpg s since playing ffx and kingdom hearts my point of entry is important when trying to explain my perspective on this game and the franchise as a whole i haven t play ffxiii in a decade so bare with me i enjoyed ffxiii for what it was an okay story about fighting fate the consequences of which are thrown upon two of the main characters who may or not be homosexual the characters are great vanille and fang at least are they have layers and different facets of their personality emerge depending on who they interact with the only two wet blankets could be snow and lightning but they serve the archetypal purpose of strong stoic character and another who is romantically in love the thematic link between all the mc s are wanting to protect someone who seems fated to die leave they all fight the power oppressors and it leads to being able to get what they want besides two of the main characters because they were the cause of much of the suffering thesis statement who defies fate should they defy fate what are the consequences answer you can you must consequences are worse if you hold off presumably even then the ending is ambiguous enough to allow the viewer the freedom to decide what was right themselves final fantasy x favorite top of all time sort of begins like an isekai anime you are thrown into the world without any prior knowledge you learn and feel for the racism of the al bhed and rikku yuna as half al bhed draws parallels to the half guado villain seymour the main characters abandonment issues are address directly through out the game in his fathers character interactions through flashbacks and indirectly through inner thoughts of tidus the religion portrayed throughout the game is shown with reverence and is heavily catholic inspired it works to help draw the player into believing in the use of the religion for the characters then slowly they dish out the relevatory lies you learn through minor characters and historians what the world used to be like while everything in the beginning is explained exposition they still have cutscenes to show ritualistic dances and movements to add more culture to the religion while characters may not be the most exciting they all have interesting personality quirks and a arc this with an innovative level up system and great story with scope this is not even mentioning how every area to me is memorable maclania crystal moon flow a river on an elephant with shumi bluemen farplanes thunderplanes this not even mentioning again the fantastic sequel which finishes minor character arcs maechen the supposed classic i remember hating the story the first time around i replayed it sometime in and was surprised at how much the game tries to be the best game ever made pushing the playstation to its limit expressive character movements portray emotions such as anger and sadness the music is sweeping and sprawling i love the way it plays with memory and trauma theres nuance for a story about an evil corporation which ff is lacking altogether shinra the company is not all evil avalanche is not all good like it has great pace which drops off in the second and third disc still great and charming the cursing is absolutely sublime the sh t cid and barret says to sherry and cloud respectively second favorite drops off right at the end amaxing sprite work each character has an arc wor is a doozy but thats another plus ff is pretty close to but its been awhile i started to replay in and was struck by the visuals and fun mc s it looks like picture book or a stage play i found it odd the hate for the game i get not liking but come on ff games are mostly cute i like more than but its been so long

exeptionally bad piece of software what i got exceeded my expectations by a long margin this game is believe it or not but first things first it is terrible just plain awful even if you thought the story of the first final fantasy xiii was fine and never left any questions unanswered story will most likely go over your head i have to admit it lost me very early on it makes sense in the end but then again not really don t try to wrap your head around it it s not even the fact that it is about time travel which in itself has always been one of the most confusing topics in movies and video games no it s just that the story writer went and took a rather simple concept and filled it with lots and lots of technobabbles and weird pseudo scientific assumptions to make it sound more complex than it actually is some of the dialogues in this game reminded me of what it feels like to watch an episode of star trek half the time they don t make any sense other times the characters just blurt out seemingly random thoughts and assertions which we are apparently supposed to take for granted more often than not they just make up the rules as they go along it starts with lines like to which to the answer is you ll hear the paradoxes did it bit a lot or how about this one from the casino just go with it there is only one real way to play this game in my opinion turn your brain off don t think too much about what s happening take in the atmosphere and relax whilst listening to the phenomenally good soundtrack which leads me to the next bullet point if you compare it directly to final fantasy xiii then this game is undoubtedly much more open every map has lots of secret and sometimes invisible stuff to discover in every corner and i personally just love the attention to detail everywhere like when your character s foot step noise dynamically changes depending on the surface he s walking on including small puddles on the pavement or when you use your weird moogle magic and every npc in the vicinity gathers around in curiousity the world generally feels alive and is really atmospheric my only gripe is the way they handled invisible level bounderies it is kind of immersion breaking when your characters can jump up towering trees that are dozens of meters high but at the same time the knee high rubble in another area proves to be an insurmountable obstacle and you need to find a way around it some of the aforementioned items you can find allow you to unlock more and more areas and side quests speaking of side quests though the area selection hub does in my opinion a poor job in distinguishing the main story line from side quests with how often i traveled back and forth between different time lines and areas i wasn t always quite sure if i was doing a mandatory or an optional quest and in some cases a quest is even optional in the beginning up until the game tells you that it is now mandatory for the story progression and you realize you already did all that hours ago oh well the missions itself feature a good variety of objectives nothing out of the ordinary but they usually require specific actions in specific locations and times to change something along the time line it never felt like i was doing boring chores now let s get to my favorite part of the game aside from walking around and talking to npcs the field gameplay features small puzzles every now and then most of them are insultingly easy though some of them are plain annoying now the battle system is largely the same as xiii s however it has one neat little addition you can now recruite pok mon to fight at your site i have to admit i m a sucker for the shin megami tensei series and its demon recruiting and fusion mechanic and final fantasy system is kind of similar to this whenever you kill a monster there is a chance to capture it you now have your very own lvl version of this monster with basic abilities which you can either keep leveling up with specific monster materials random drops loot can be bought later or you decide to infuse it in order to pass some of its abilities on to a stronger monster this way you can spend dozens of hours trying to create unique and powerful allies unfortunately as much as you can customize your monsters the same thing does not apply to your main characters their level progression is much more set in stone both of them have obvious roles they excell at like serah is a much better ravager than noel while noel is the better synergist and so on so you obviously want to focus on these first additionally the very high encounter rate lets you accumulate way too many cp exp too quickly leading to overleveled characters who steamroll every story boss in a matter of seconds both main characters even stopped learning new abilities about and were completely maxed out a little over halfway through the game speaking of encounters in this game they technically aren t random encounters as they appear on the map in front of you and you could theoretically avoid them this is easier said than done however as many of the enemies move significantly faster than you and hit you before you can escape one thing i did like about the encounters though was how in some locations there is a rare chance to spawn significantly stronger monsters than usual sort of like optional bosses who randomly appear in certain regions and don t worry even if you manage to die at any point you will never lose anything you have the option to retry any battle at any time and the game generally autosaves left and right the autosave feature also reminds me of my final bullet point lets get this straight the pc version of final fantasy is one of the worse console ports out there thus it can and will randomly crash during loading screens it autosaves everytime you enter or exit an area so i never lost any progress personally another problem is the awful frame rate currently there is no surefire way to fix the frame rate stuttering everyone has forcing v sync and triple buffering and disabling the weird maximized windowed mode yes the game runs in windowed mode even if you choose the full screen option in the launcher made it somewhat bearable for me some of the more populated areas will most likely always cause problems though if they ever manage to fix these issues this whole point becomes moot but until this happens the game may or may not give you a headache due to its unstable framerate '],Recommended

found not only the song volume was all over the place from song to song but the battle sounds were still much louder than the voices so sometimes when characters talk during battle like when we hear

something happens to a new slot is impossible this is a rather annoying flaw but since the game is meant to be played again and again i can t go back and catch the story action again any time soon but eventually instead which can be very irritating especially if i wasn t expecting story action thankfully story action can be paused but i m not particularly used to doing has made some worth while improvements over time for the good i can change the leader during battle this allows more control during combat compared to monsters can be recruited which is interesting although it s one of those things that could have a better set of data for the player so they don t feel forced to look at guides for the sake of their third party member tpm although the main characters in have access to job names identical to those from they have some significant limitations which are made up for with the tpm s power flexibility which is kept in check by the fact players can only switch between different monsters in a battle each is a single job character those points above bring life into the combat system which is an important part of any rpg there s no shortage of enemies that are undefeatable and enemies that are challenging to keep players wondering about the game this is the plus side to the minus of constantly feeling like i m going back and forth like a ping pong ball unlike the way a traditional rpg outfits are pretty interesting i can use the default outfits for serah and mog as well as her sidekick noel or some alternative outfits however there are not very many outfits for them except for mog black white mage outfits are the good ones i like cat the most for mog but i would like to assume with so many outfits that many people like some other outfits more the outfits work very well and are present in most has a guest fighter in one of the zones which brings back the nostalgia from many of the previous ff games i also think it improves in at least one way compared to includes music from although it won t happen in the first zones accessed i like good music and some of the best songs from make a return in i dislike that they took away everything from ffx s combat system when making it had a decent combat system in its own right but for a sequel it felt kind of bad not improving upon the old however i don t think ffx s combat system was as bad as ffxiii s using any older battle system even if it was a poor one and then making it better big thump up from me will update the review after doing the post game content '],Recommended

finale intro first if you have windows dont buy this most problems are held buy people with windows but not held by others it isn t properly supported dont get it next i ve played this game for hrs by saying this most gamers understand the amount of experience i have with this story based game that can be finished in hrs compared to an angry review after of blindly butting heads with the terrible edit bad port this is a review by someone who has played through this game for a significant amount of time why this should honestly not be recommended a this review is from a gamer that played this pc version for months i want to say that i honestly think this is a great game brought from the but the performance put out by the port isnt very good unless your pc runs at some amazing stats its hard to play at anything other than the base image settings and the fps is still pretty bad b one of the biggest problems happens during cinematic cutscenes your game will try to load a lot of new information and also try to autosave which worked on the console however the longer you play the game the more information the game will tryto process i e completed ongoing quests certain events that need to be implemented and the biggest thing are savestates which will take a significant amount of processinging all occuring in the small amount of time oof moving between the world you are in and the world select whenever you transition between worlds which in mid to late game is a significant amout of times this game will try to load process and save all at the same time during the early game this problem isn t very apparent but at hrs the change becomes much more apparent eventually past hrs triggering even small cutscenes which automatically load and autosave at the same time will often crash the game causing whatever progress was made to all feel worthless while the game itself is fun and engaging with a great story and good design the pc version has its issues c occasionally if the amount of data in your savestate is fairly high hrs worth but possibly less steamcloud where all default savestates are managed will randomly move essentually deleting them meaning that they are no longer accessable to you from your main menu or found any where in your pc s files leaving only the new game option available recommended and advice a steamcloud shouldn t be turned on while playing this game there is a warning on the launcher stating that processing may take longer because of steamclouds synchronisation with the servor the fact that there is any kind of warning on the launcher should be a clear indicator that there is a problem there will be planty of times that steamcloud will start synchronizing and crash your game it would be best if you played this while in offline mode the trophies may be fun to get but if you want to enjoy this game its not worth the risk s b make sure you create an independent save file location that is not managed by steam frequently delete unnecessary savestates and you can keep the amount of information processed farther on in the game to a more manageable amount c keep your settings low again this port isn t the most capable during the early game when the amount of data being processed is rather low it should be fine to raise the settings to whatever your pc can handle just remember that even if your game runs fairly smoothly later on in the game cutscenes and loading processing requirements will grow at a steepening curve whatever you can do to help your game run smoothly even at the cost of quality is worth it d look up crysterium and monster guides before you leave the first world like others in the ff series this game will seem fairly easy at first but even moreso then prievious games it will absolutly punish unknowing mistakes stopping you from even reaching the late game let alone post game leveling the crysterium essentually levels is an irreversable process that if left to a novice will cause any small mistakes in building your character that might not be so relevent early on will become devestating to those that want to enjoy the late game d i monsters play a huge role in this game and just like with crysterium are a major part of the game that will eventually be the focus of your team as in they will be the party member that you recruit train and carry you through the game d ii while its not neccesary to look up guides on these to succeed it is reccommended finding the hidden monster s that can become the gods to carry you through late game and final bosses finding the correct infusiuon recipes to build them into said gods finding which monsters youll need to grind for in certain conditons and realising before you kill certain indespensible and unrespawnable monsters that you actually need them and should save in front of them and soft reset if you dont get it until you altogether this is a great game i would say that this port has to many problems that havent been corrected and can only be managed by the user who pays the full price for this but then has to do the providers job of making it usable in order to actually play this after playing over hrs on the pc version of this game i can say that for those who still want to purchase this after reading this review follow the above recommended advice and hopefully someday this game will be patched enough that i can honestly recommend this to prospecting ff players '],Not Recommended

confusing i am not a fan of i know some games are repeats in there depending on the japanese release i have played and i wish i had skipped over this one let me explain below graphics the graphical fidelity is no better than that said it s not an ugly game by any means i noticed my laptop which is not equipped for high end gaming tended to chug harder and burn hotter than when i played the pc port i found this strange since i noticed draw distance tended to be better on you ll also note the lack of monsters and their animations on the overworld map so why is this game more taxing presentation it s not any uglier than that s for sure but the characters are a lot flatter we didn t get to see much from serah in but in the actress seems a lot less interested and passionate at times the body language is overplayed and at other times there s no body language beyond standing arms akimbo setting i could ask what setting a lot of reviewers have said that you don t need to play in order to play this game that s true but you won t understand anything unless you read through all of the primers on the main screen even if you do the plot won t make much sense was enchanting because it introduced a novel theme that seemed unfamiliar a great purge of unclean civilians united six heroes who gain magical abilities to unite the citizens of a police state world to overthrow their god like leaders sounds nice right the setting of the sequel builds off of that but instead of introducing a unique or innovative story arch it starts from where left off our protagonist serah can t remember what happened how convenient and she has been separated from her sister and her lover a timelord deus ex machina character is introduced in the form of noel kreis lightning serah s sister summons him from another plane of time and reality to do her bidding the rest is in the plot development or lack there of but seriously time traveling my head already hurts characters noel is boring through the few hours i played he describes that he is from the future approximately years from the present plot point he explains that he has never known what a vegetable tastes like and that he is the last of man s existance so why does he look so clean and handsome and what is with his weird weapon nothing is explained noel s character design is meant to be ambiguous so we don t get too curious it s lazy and it s flat skip over this character serah is boring she acts like a scared little child when we re introduced to combat her feminization is peaked by giving her a bow and reducing her physical damage below what noel is capable of i m not promoting or dismissing any sort of female rights but i will point out that lightning was an exception to this feminization of damage rule in lightning was the female protagonist and she was more than capable of putting out tons of damage as well as taking tons of it in return she was by far one of the most powerful characters so why isn t serah kupo kupo kupo why did they add a moogle to this plot you will note that i avoided playing most of the games with a moogle in it well there s a moogle here he will plague your cutscenes and you will often find yourself hitting and skip the moogle only makes serah s sex more generalized any others i didn t get to i thought i might have picked up a new character after beating the hand in the second chapter but that was not the case i don t know what other characters exist out there but you will have to figure that out for yourself i won t touch this game again cutscenes as i stated in the graphics section the visual presentation is quite the same from that s a good thing most cutscenes look very nice one thing that upset me was the introduction of quick time events qte this requires you to make a movement or button press based on a notification on the screen from what i can tell the qtes don t actually affect anything in the plot sometimes you will notice your character painstakingly and stupidly getting squashed by a giant meteor only to roll over and get back up sometimes failing these qtes during a boss battle will result in extra damage likewise succeeding a qte might result in a status effect boost this doesn t belong in an rpg it ruined the balance and flow of the game and should not have been included gameplay the gameplay is very similar to but it feels like it behaves faster enemies seem to have less health and encountering enemies is much different you lack the techniques that you gain early on in and enemies aren t displayed on the overworld map instead enemies spawn randomly and they seem to spawn based on the number of steps you take after a certain number of steps enemies spawn and you have the choice of either running away or using the action button to swing your weapon and hit the enemy avatars if you connect before they do then you gain haste and surprise the enemy if you take too long or the enemy runs into your overworld avatars then you initiate combat as usual i initially thought this was kind of a cool idea a lot of rpgs have an initiative system however i quickly realized this was just a gimmick to reduce on screen rendering it also builds an unfair disadvantage for tactics by not showing what enemies you re up against all in all this was a failure by the creators leveling up has become a nightmare in order to create a simpler and more uniform character progression system the creators have done away with the traditional crystarium of and have created a new crystarium that allows you to choose which class you want to specialize in this character progression system feels a lot like the ff tactics games i get where the creators were coming from i am betting they received a lot of feedback from explaining why the individual crystarium stat point nodes were trivial of course you re going to level up for the least amount of cp there s no point in trying to use statistics and levels to negate that however the solution here was horrible basically every level in the crystarium is worth a certain point value regardless of what you invest it in serah and noel start with level in commando ravager and sentinel after you level up enough you can either gain a deeper specialization of these role trees or you can get an atb segment or a new role it is never explained who should specialize in what or how well rounded your party should be in each character had specialized roles and some characters synergized with others neatly i never got this feeling from give this game a i know it s rough but it simply did not capture my attention for more than a few hours it s not a bad game if you like jrpgs that are a bit over the top the fact that i enjoyed so much and yet i disliked this game really speaks volumes you don t have impressive antagonists like roche or the fal cie instead your villain is some emo kid with an ugly looking sword let me just reiterate that a lot of reviewers state that you don t need to play in order to play this game that s where they re wrong if you didn t play then you have no idea what these roles are the in game primers are brief and they don t at all explain how important these roles are i won t go into deeper specs of these roles so if you re interested please look up a game guide '],Not Recommended

technical issues mostly resulting from a bad port of the game as usual the game runs poorly capping in at no matter what the store page says about possibilities low bitrate audio crisp fmvs due to compression for some reason and the game only using of ram like the first game and of course the same author who compiled a bunch of fixes for the first game has also written a steam guide on how to enhance so go check it out as usual it contains performance fixes crash fixes and the modernization of the game although this time the hd textures are a lot more subtle than the first game there s also a mod that restores past dlcs that square enix removed due to licensing issues which is pretty nice the improvements come from the overall gameplay from redesigned drop tables and how the game calculates monster drops to tiny optimizations in the battle system the crystarium is also not as linear as it was in the first game but they went a bit overboard as it s almost impossible to understand how the thing works without looking up a guide and advancing through the crystarium willy nilly will result with you having a weaker party and may make the game quite more difficult than it should be in the late game traversing the game world isn t as linear as the first game as well unlike ffxiii where you just follow a predetermined path up until the third to the last chapter which goes back again to being linear a couple of chapters later offers players the freedom to explore any place they want at any time emphasis on which makes for a very modular non linear way of playing the game of course some places have higher levelled enemies than the others which would indirectly guide you back to where the game wants you to be but it isn t as spoon fed as the first game and if you persevere enough even places blocked by the sheer level of enemies are still doable the biggest change in my opinion is the introduction of it s basically like pokemon where you capture a monster that you fight and have it battle for you in instead of a human party member you will be utilizing the powers of monsters each monster specializing in their own role and one role only unlike in ffxiii where you can pretty much choose from any role at any time limits that by making your third party member be of limited roles you can only have up to three third roles that you can switch between gil is not a notable issue anymore in the game you still need a hefty amount of it when you re building your monsters but unlike the first game you can easily amass gil as you play through the story in my experience i had amassed over thousand gil just from clearing chapters and no items are ridiculously expensive in the shop which is really nice as well no more million gil material that you will only use once and you have to get another one way or another cp just like in the previous game can be acquired as you play the game and you almost don t need to grind for it or at least don t directly grind because capturing monsters isn t as simple as it seems and you will probably need to fight a lot of enemies to find really good monsters to add to your party which in turn will make you amass a lot of cp before you even realize it you can easily be underlevelled in this game but it s as easy to be overlevelled as well that s because the crystarium stages aren t locked behind story progression so if you have so much free time in your life and perseverance you can upgrade both characters crystarium to the latest stage even during the early game another thing that i liked about this game square removed the tedious way of levelling and upgrading weapons and accessories you can now just buy weapons to replace your current ones and the shop will even offer you the upgraded version of the weapons in exchange for gil and materials that are relatively easy to acquire compared to traps and dark matter which means pretty cheap too and most of them come from enemies that are relatively easy to kill compared to toises and long guis of course there s still materials that can only be acquired from rare spawning enemies and the material itself is a rare drop from said enemies but the game introduces a new feature called to help you with the grind one of the key objectives in the game is to collect fragments i won t be diving into what these are but if you collect enough of these you can talk to an npc that will give you depending on how far you are in the game and how many fragments you have collected so far these fragment skills range from little adjustments like being able to move the camera during cutscenes to insane game altering effects like making rare enemies to spawn more often or increase the amount of enemies that you can encounter each of this fragment skill has their own use and you can tweak them any time you want beating the game will also give you a fragment skill to see other endings that you normally couldn t get which adds more to the non linearity of the game i think this is what really separates from its predecessor ffxiii practically has no post game content once you beat the game it s pretty much the end of course you can fill out all the characters crystarium to their maximum level after beating the game but there s not much to it the ci eth stone missions that you have to do after beating the game is only that way because you are virtually limited by your characters stats that are locked behind the stage crystarium that can only be unlocked after beating the game but technically speaking you can do all ci eth stone missions even before the final boss thus technically making post game content non existent i really feel that ffxiii had a dlc that never came to be since all post game content is all about making your characters even stronger but that s a topic for another day in you get the alternate endings called after you beat the game and there are a handful of them to go through the game also has actual dlcs to play through after beating the game which i think ffxiii is really lacking like i mentioned earlier and it will take you hours to finish all of them the dlc even includes literally a coliseum where you can fight a bunch of enemies to test your skills and the monsters that you have built throughout the game unlike ffxiii where the only post game you can do are the ci eth stone missions that you can actually do before beating the game actually offers content that you can only do after beating it like i said i grinded for materials and monsters in the game so you can pretty much shave of to hours off of the recorded playtime in this review i am also writing this review before doing post game so expect the playtime hours to jump to i don t know i guess maybe to hours more i am still not finished building my monsters and i have yet to begin viewing the paradox endings let alone the dlcs and stuffs however as much as i like this game and being the cheapskate that i am i still recommend buying this game on sale it s a pretty old game especially if you count the years from its initial release on the and spending almost bucks to play it with technical issues that square could have easily fixed but didn t isn t really worth it but i really recommend playing this game especially if you liked the first game '],Recommended

have had so much fun with after my soul draining experience with ffxiii it is no exaggeration that square enix took fan feedback from the first game close to their hearts and did a thorough a with this game in fact square enix made such drastic measures that they retconned the ending of ffxiii and pretty much wrote away most of the l cie fal cie and focus jargon this is one of the few games i ve played where the sequel is so much better than its predecessor that you could just pretend that the first game never existed another game series that comes to mind is mass effect and mass effect story takes place directly after ffxiii and changes the ending instead of lightning reuniting with her sister serah lightning is literally erased from history and everyone believes that she sacrificed herself along with vanille and fang to save the inhabitants of cocoon the only person that seems to remember what truly happened is serah the cause of all this is caius a man in a purple jumpsuit and wields a cool looking sword eye weapon who has manipulated time itself for some nefarious purpose it is up to serah and noel a mysterious time traveler from the future to fix the time paradoxes and confront caius as a time travel story the game completely misses the mark and tries to explain mysterious things because of time magic fortunately at least what story has going for it is that it is at least mildly comprehensible with no need to consult the datalog there are also nice episodic recaps everytime you load your save in the first hour of gameplay you can tell square enix immediately did right with this game characters no longer spout non sequiturs at each other there are multiple branching paths to explore you can actually talk and have conversations with npcs and finally you can access most of the gameplay immediately with the rest unlocking within the first three hours the paradigm system from ffxiii also got a revamp serah and noel will always be in your party with a rotating slot used for monsters that s right is also a pok mon esk monster collecting game each monster represents a specific crystarium role and it becomes a quest in itself to find and raise the best commandos ravagers medics etc that said if you didn t enjoy the paradigm system in the first game this game will not be changing your mind i was not a fan of some of the other changes that square enix has made for some reason they learned that that qtes are pretty popular with the kids these days and included them throughout the game the qtes show up in cutscenes and during battle hitting every qte will deal bonus damage or reward you with a special prize fortunately failing the qtes isn t an automatic fail another feature included is branching dialog sequences while branching dialog is much appreciated as it helps flesh out serah and noel it usually only rewards an item if you pick the one correct serious choice there are also severe pacing issues with first episodes are fairly easy and straightforward to follow the episode is gated off until serah and noel collect specific fragments located in various timelines the game give you hints in which timelines and areas to find these fragments but the problem is the game does not tell you how in order to reach these specific timelines you need to have enough wild artefacts the keys to opening these timelines the game never keeps track of which locations have wild artefacts are in them and it becomes painfully annoying to scour through each and every timeline for them the problem is also exacerbated when these wild artefacts are impossible to access without pursuing some relatively long quest lines unless if by dumb luck you opened the right timelines and did the right quests i strongly recommend resorting to a guide if you get stuck at this suffers from a low production value and most of the content is recycled from the original game the new music is eclectic and random and doesn t quite feel like a final fantasy soundtrack there are some catchy tracks like the red chocobo song but also random ones like this heavy metal song they put in some boss fights most of the character models and monsters are recycled from the original voice acting with the exception of the main cast is shotty with mog being the most annoying to listen to lip syncing is poorly done and you can notice characters moving their lips but not matching what they re saying the poor production values also creep their way onto the pc port of the game on windows the game will crash within the first few minutes of gameplay due to a memory issue the framerate advertised to run up to fps regularly dips down to fps even on powerful rigs i experienced no issues playing ffxiii on pc so it s strange how all of these bugs happen with the sequel luckily there is a great ff fan community that has provided most of the fixes to these issues see it is a shame that square enix did not patch their game even though it has been released almost years ago and counting final fantasy feels like a game that took major risks and paid off rather than living in the shadow of the first game and playing it safe square enix decided to take the series into a whole new direction with this sequel the game oozes with new ideas some brilliant and some awful this is a game that is so different from its predecessor that saying it is the sequel to final fantasy xiii is an insult yes it is using the same main characters and battle system but it does so much more than the original despite my complaints i enjoyed my time playing final

2928,Razi,52.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raziadastra/,"February 16, 2015",0,['is such a good game that it almost makes me like ffxiii in retrospect almost first let s just get the elephant in the room out of the way yes this port is terribly optimized it may work fine for some but i played at with drops with is really pretty abysmal the only thing this has over playing on console is resolution and the ability to use the japanese audio the japanese audio by the way is fantastic so now on to the good i played through ffxiii and really hated the experience by the end and still consider it the worst entry in the franchise then this game comes along and basically fixes every problem i had with the original paradigm switching is now instant a no brainer change really but it changes the pace of battle so much when you don t have to watch the camera stupidly focus in on every party member one at a time for each paradigm shift you can now tame wild monsters and have them fight along side you this not only goes a long way towards offering the player choice in how to compose their party early on but it s also just a lot of fun finding badass or adorable monsters and taming them the game just generally utilizes the game mechanics much more i was forced to rapidly switch between paradigms and change up my party compositions so much more than the original boss fights typically include qte s to finish off the fight some might take issue with this but i liked them and it made beating bosses feel really satisfying reminded me of bayonetta enemies no longer appear in the field all the time but rather randomly show up in circle around you as you walk around this isn t reeeaaally a positive or negative change but what is better is that you now have a dedicated attack button to get the drop on enemies instead of runnung around in circles like an idiot tryng to run into enemies from behind like in the original actually there is a negative to be mentioned here difficulty spikes i have no problem with challenging games but when a section or boss comes out of nowhere and just wipes the floor with you repeatedly it tends to raise an eyebrow this thankfully only happened to me twice once in the middle and then final crazy boss but it was more than a little annoying the original game had you do things and things only walk forward and fight enemies not only gets you up and running with all the game mechanics much quicker but generally has a greater amount of variety in it s gameplay including actual sidequests and lots of em npc s to talk to and interact with lots of those too branching pathways and areas that aren t a simple straight line monsters to tame and level up fight with a chocobo at your side you have an adorable moogle companion who you can throw yes throw to reach far away treasure a small but hilarious addition the crystarium has been changed it s still a pretty linear affair but every time you fill up a full grid or screen or whatever you can choose a big reward like adding a new section to the atb guage or even unlocking a new role i was completely sick of most of the characters in ffxiii by the time i was through with it serah and noel are thankfully handled in a much better fashion i found serah to be likeable from the get go and while her motivations aren t really that deep i just want to see my sister again she s characterized really well and her sincerity is really charming then noel is like ff s version of riku minus the being a d ck to the main character part both have really solid voice acting whether playing in japanese or english this game is also pretty dark which might not be what you expect from looking at it the farther and farther into the future you travel the more hopeless things become this sense of desperation to me is the heart of final fantasy on a similar note the time travelling is a lot of fun seeing how the world and characters change depending on what time period or even timeline they re in is really interesting there s a good chance you ll get sick of hearing the word paradox though you ve been warned the soundtrack is phenominal the original certainly wasn t dragging it s feet in this department but i feel like it fell a bit short of pulling off a different sounding ff score absolutely pulls it off the three composers have put together an awesome collection of beautiful tracks ranging from the classic ff sounds to some more electronically infused numbers and best of all a handfull of tracks that include vocals the new bodhum theme alone sets this score apart the game s a looker no doubt about that special mention goes to the animation however as i think square is really great at animating their characters and especially faces there is one more negative however and that s how the game handles it s ending to see the real ending you have to play a thankfully included dlc chapter that is incredibly tedious and feels entirely divorced from the whole experience it s weird that square would get such a huge amount of things right in this game and then bork up the delivery of the ending yeah just weird that aside i can t recommend this game enough if you already liked the first then you robably didn t need any convincing anyway but if you are like me and hated the original then i have to urge you to give this one a shot it s not often that a studio puts in this much effort into fixing a game so when they do i think they deserve to be rewarded '],Recommended
