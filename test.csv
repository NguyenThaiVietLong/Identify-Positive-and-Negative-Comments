bearer seek seek lest,65.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/caralde/,"June 2, 2019",146,"Let me be clear: this port is absolutely abysmal. If you don't want to go through the effort of fixing it (which is fairly easy, to be honest), then do not buy this game. Moreover, if you don't have a controller you can play this game with, DO NOT BUY IT. It's not that keyboard controls are bad, but if you don't have a controller plugged in, the game checks for one every second frame (not an exaggeration), causing terrible, terrible stuttering. If you don't have a controller (DS4, Xbone, etc.) then there is absolutely no way to fix this.I'll start by going over how to fix this mess of a port. There are only a few things you'll need to do, but they'll turn this game from an unplayable mess to a great experience. First, download and install the Console Content Patch mod (following the ReadMe's directions). This is needed to ensure that everything else works, and it also gives you a few nice cosmetics and accessories. Let me emphasize this. YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST. Installing mods in any other order will still work, but in order to gain access to console-exclusive DLC, you HAVE TO install this first. Next, you'll want to install the Leviathan's Tear's mod, which fixes the rain sprite (w/o this mod rain looks like your computer is having a stroke, and there are some required levels where rain is abundant).This part gets its own paragraph because it'll be where you get the game to run above 30fps consistently. After doing the above steps, download the FFXIII-2FPSUnlock tool and run that before you start the game. In order to use it properly, you'll need to give it access to ffxiii-2img.exe, which is actually the main game's file (generally found in steamapps/common/ffxiii-2/directory OR  steamapps/common/ffxiii-2/alba_data/prog/win/bin). Then, click ""make backup"" and ""unlock framerate 1"", followed by ""apply"". After this point, your game should be running at a constant 45-60 fps, but if it's not, there are some alternatives. You can either try using the same tool's ""unlock framerate 2"", and for failure of that, use the Final Fantasy XIII-2 Fixer. Be warned though, the fixer does incur longer load times.Last step now, and this is important. Turn steam cloud sync off for this game. If it's on, you'll crash every 15-20 minutes.  Autosave mitigates the saving issue, but crashing every 15 minutes just gets annoying after a while.All that being said, is the game actually worth going to all this effort for? In my opinion, it definitely is. Sure, the story's premise isn't the best, but I'd argue that while the ideas are fairly poor, the execution is actually very well done. Serah and Noel are fairly likable characters at the start, and they really grew on me as I played through the game. Without spoiling too much, Liam O'Brien does a fantastic job voicing the villain, as per usual, and Laura Bailey is spot on as Serah. 13-2 fixes everything 13 did wrong, giving the player a good deal of freedom in exploring maps that are actually maps instead of hallway schematics, while also fixing the tedious nature of 13's combat through a number of means. Namely, through actual sidequests that are present throughout the whole game, an interesting monster system where the third member of your party is a beast you've tamed and subjugated (and yes, the monsters are significantly more varied than in 13, trust me), and many diverse (and beautiful) environments. You can also explore the same environments at different times, and I'm not talking day/night cycles here. For example, Academia in 4XX AF (AF is years and also a spoiler for 13 so I won't say what it stands for) is a paradise, while in an alternate timeline, Academia 400 AF is overrun by Cie'th abominations.Combat is great, and the game's difficulty is just high enough to prevent ""auto-battle to win"" while also ensuring you never have to grind too much.Is 13-2 perfect? Not at all. Like I said earlier, the story is very flawed, and some story twists are very predictable. Even so, the game itself did a great job of keeping me interested in the world and its characters, while also never getting repetitive and bland like 13 did. Overall, I'd give it an 8./10 (I'd have given it a 9, but the sheer amount of research I had to do in order to get it running was obscene. The guide above should circumvent that.)Here is the link for the game's mod directory. You'll find everything I mentioned in the guide above and more (extra monsters, outfits, etc.):",Recommended,
Neo,69.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YorHAGestalt/,"October 27, 2020",230,"If you want to experience Final Fantasy XIII-2 in the best way possible, please click these two links to enhance the experience; otherwise, it'll be hampered by this game's abominable PC port, kupo.Click this  and here It's still unacceptable for the publisher to not put more care and effort into the port, but these will mitigate and improve your experience, kupo.------------------------------------------------------Nowonto the game, kupoEven though this is a sequel to FFXIII, you don't need to play the first game to understand the narrative, except being oblivious to the context of certain plot elements to the story, kupo. However, the game recaps and reminisces on all the events in the previous game, but if you have OCD, then play the games in order, kupo. The story is... convoluted, disheveled and tortuous, and it's primarily because the game's story revolves around time travel, kupo. And given its ignominious reputation for how contrived of a plot device it is, this game will confuse you about all the concomitant inconsistencies of the paradoxes and its effects on the new, repaired timelines of each location, kupo. I don't recommend having a critical mind when analyzing the story. kupo. It's much easier to enjoy the narrative that way because Noel and Caius are such great, sympathetic characters, sharing a lot of heartfelt moments, kupo.The other characters aren't... terrible, but they're bland or underutilized, which includes Serah, one of main protagonists of this game, kupo. She's not annoying, but she's rather uninteresting and stagnant in terms of character development, kupo. Though I must say, Mog is the cute and loveable, kupo. I do appreciate how the game's narrative establishes rules and consequences for fixing the timeline, so it's not a travesty in terms of progression, kupo.This game improves on almost every aspect of the original game, kupo. The maps are more vast, non-linear, and have multiple routes to explore for fragments, quest items, encounters with special enemies, collecting spheres, etc., kupo. You only control Noel and Serah, which means you don't have to exercise your muscle memory by switching between multiple characters, like you do in the first game (That's subjective, though. I don't mind how either game handles their characters), kupo. Eidolons are completely absent, and instead of having a third character to fight alongside you, this game introduces monsters that you can tame by collecting their crystals by defeating them enough times, kupo The Paradigm Shifts function exactly the same as the first game, so you'll be comfortable to transition from the first game to this one, kupo. For newcomers, it's a battle system that uses ATB (Active Time Battle) for different battle modes:Commando (focused on attacks), kupoRavager (focused on magic), kupoSentinel (focused on defense), kupoMedic (focused on healing vitality), kupoSaboteur (focused on inflicting negative status ailments), kupoSynergist (focused on inflicting positive status ailments), kupoYou can customize roles for each mode to suit your playstyle, with the monster that's built for one specific role and upgrade them with the crystogen points (for Noel and Serah) and monster materials (for monsters), kupo.As the name implies, you shift being Paradigms for the optimal battle strategy, kupo. Each mode has different, unique abilities that you need to take advantage of when encountering and staggering enemies, especially the very difficult ones, kupo. It's a bit confusing at first, but once you understand the mechanics, it's very entertaining and enjoyable, kupo. The gameplay is very solid, kupo. There are puzzles in this game whenever you enter sporadic temporal rifts to resolve anomalies of a paradox, kupo. They're harmless (except the clock puzzle), but they're entertaining to figure out the solution, kupo. The graphics are gorgeous, the bosses are very challenging, and agonizing sometimes, the locations are breathtaking and creative, the live triggers, which are simply ""choose your dialogue to influence the story,"" are cool, and the seldom QTE's are actually interesting, kupo. Not only do the QTE's change the scenery depending on your choice, but they reward you with bonus points for perfecting them. kupo.And lastly, kupo...Mother of Vahalla, the music is SUPERB, KUPO!!! Everything about it is masterful and varied, kupo. This is easily the best soundtrack in any Final Fantasy game, kupo. It's absolutely fantastic and godlike, kupo. I LOVE IT, KUPO!!!! This game is great despite the messy story, and if you download those patches, it'll make experiencing this underrated gem all the more worth it, kupoWhy am I saying kupo in every sentence, you may ask, kupo? I don't know, kupo",Recommended,
Lycaon,71.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072033624/,"January 10, 2015",183,"After complaints of FFXIII's too linear gameplay, FFXIII-2 seems to be the answer to everyone's cries. In the beginning, you still get some of the ""run to the yellow pointer"" moments, but you can also take on various side-quests from NPCs to either find something or kill a monster. And once the game gets going, depending on what gates you open, you can have your choice of next destination. And you can take a break on minigame quizzes, chocobo racing, or slot machines if you feel inclined to do so.The one complaint I personally have is compared to FFXIII's story (personally I loved it), FFXIII-2 falls a bit short. The time travel trope makes it feel a bit cliché, and I found Noel to be quite boring in terms of personality and back story. Personal opinion, but even if the story isn't your thing, the game is a lot of fun.In combat, the ATB gauge and paradigm shifts are back so that will feel familiar. But with only two protagonists, the third slot is filled by monsters you tame. With all the tameable monsters out there, you can really customize your party to your needs, and you have to level your monsters up as well. I was a bit annoyed that neither Serah or Noel learned Faith/Bravery/Haste as Synergists so you have to rely completely on monsters to buff you on that front.As for the PC port, the keyboard can be a little awkward with the more complicated constellation puzzles, when the camera gets a little wonky, but it's still possible, if not, frustrating. I've also had the game just close on me once or twice (guessing my laptop was overworked when playing this game for an extended amount of time). Other than that, I have no issues. (Note the DLC doesn't unlock until you beat the story once.)Basically, the game is a load of fun even if the story fell short of expectations. The story isn't bad per se, but it wasn't great either. That said, the gameplay makes up for it. Still working on those final fragments.",Recommended,

theLittleCroissant,6.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LittleCwoissant/,"March 13, 2024",70,"Alright, after 2 hours of searching the web, I was able to fix 2 of the main problems that spawned the most reviews in this game. 1.) You will need to download a 4GB mod. Because the game is only using 2GB of RAM on your computer. It will keep crashing until you download the mod. Go to Program x86 -> Steam -> Steamapps -> Common -> FINAL FANTASY XIII-2. That is where you will find the ffxiii2img file. After you download the 4GB.exe file, you will have to open it, then go to that ffxiii2img file. Click it, then it should install the mod into your game. I finished doing this can it has been running without any crashes.2.) If you have done the mod method and it still crashes, disable steam cloud in your game's settings by going to it's properties. I tried this method first; however, it was still crashing. So that's when I tried the 4GB mod and that's what permanently fixed my issues. This method is just in case.3.) If the sound in your headphones is constantly buzzing, just go to your control panel -> sound -> whatever audio device you're using -> properties -> advanced -> enhanced audio = uncheck box [down at the very bottom].Can you find all of this information yourself? Yes. Why am I posting it in this review? Because, like I said, it took me 2 hours to find and input all of this into my game. And hopefully, this will save players some time. Should we have to download mods and reset some settings in order to play ported games? No. But if you spent $10-$20 on a game, you deserve to play it.This game is one of my favorites. From the character designs to the soundtrack. Just a great game. And I like anything to do with time travel, so this game has everything I like. Also, in English, Jason Marsden voices Noel. He also voices Haku (Spirited Away); Max Goof (A Goofy Movie); Thackery Binx (Hocus Pocus); and Kovu (Lion King 2: Simba's Pride). How can I not get this game?

The paradigm combat system runs better than ever (no annoying 5 second transition occurring with your first paradigm shift every battle! ^_^ ) .  Soundtrack is a real treat, probably better than the first one IMO. And while this is just a personal taste sorta thing, some may disagree I really enjoy having Serah and Noel as protagonists. So overall, I'd recommend the game highly if you're willing to put in the work to get it running. Doesn't justify how poorly it was optimized to begin with by Square, but it's at least playable and more importantly, enjoyable with some tinkering.",Recommended,

"Sekhi, Booper of Snoots",51.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfae/,"December 16, 2015",66,"UPDATE 6/11/16:  I do Tumblr reviews now, here's a more in-depth look at this one.!!!-THIS IS IMPORTANT-!!!If you buy this game, DISABLE STEAM CLOUD SAVES FOR IT! This game and the Steam Cloud don't get along, and it causes the game to occasionally crash when it tries to save. Here's the catch, the game autosaves frequently. This makes crashes more of an annoyance than anything, but also a lot more frequent.If you download this game, make sure to disable Steam Cloud Saves before you play it otherwise it'll constantly ♥♥♥♥ up unless you do some deep down work in your game files and move your save file... or start over completely from scratch. Trust me, its worth doing, especially since some of the crashes will take Steam down with it.EDIT: I changed the save settings and played the game for a solid three hours. As of now I have not had any crashes at all. Trust me on this one guys, the save file thing will fix most of the technical issues here.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now then, as for the game itself. In my opinion, this game takes everything that FFXIII did wrong and fixes them. No more scrounging for bits to upgrade your weapons slower than molasses, no more endless tunnel for the first half of the game, the Crystal Talent Tree dealie is a lot easier to use and a lot more fun.Immediate Changes:Gil and Weapons: Weapon upgrades are a thing of the past. You still collect bits, but the bits are used to make entirely new weapons at the shop rather than simply rubbing them all over your current ones. They're also a lot easier to come by. Also, all enemies drop Gil again as they should have done in FFXIII.Open Endedness: In extremely stark contrast to FFXIII's endless corridor first half that got so many gamers up in arms, this time you play Serah and this boy from 700 years in the future named Noel as you go all throughout time and space to unravel the mystery of time paradoxes that are plauging Grand Pulse. You unlock new time periods and locations quickly throughout the game and it feels much more immersive than before.Crystalized Monsters: So... its just Serah and Noel for your party members, but how the hell does that work? Simple. Serah can crystalize and command monsters to fight for her. Remember those bits you'd gather off monsters? You use them to level up the guys you capture! Each monster is locked into a specific role (Cait Sith is always medic for example) but you can have three ready to fight alongside you at a time. In addition, each monster has their own Feral Link attack where you can use a special limit-break-esque trick with them in the middle of a fight.Costumes: Serah and Noel both start out with four costumes; their default outfits and three extra ones, and they unlock more as the game goes on (I assume, I'm not super-far yet). Still, makes it more interesting to look at thats for sure. Your little moogle companion, Mog, also gains about two dozen right from the get go. Want a little demon moogle? How about a cat? Perhaps a living sentient moogle plushie? Why not Zoidberg (give it time, it'll get modded in and you know it)?Outside of that, here's the basic rundown.PROS:- Game feels much more immersive and streamlined than before, also much more engaging right from the start (I went ahead and downloaded the song 'Etro's Champion' off iTunes after hearing it in the opening bits too, so the soundtrack is solid).- If you skipped FFXIII or never finished it then you can watch a 'Beginner's Guide' that tells the highlights of the FFXIII story and what happened through it. It's split up into chapters too so you can skip the bits you already saw if you like.- No more scraping together Gil for weapon upgrades. All the monsters drop money now and the weapons are sold pre-made, though you can save up bits and buy custom weapons with special effects (and reduced pricetags since you supplied the parts).- The Crystal Tree (Crystalium, Crystalum, Crystalvalium, whatever) is a lot easier to use now and takes a lot less grinding to get the most out of it.CONS:- BEWARE CRASHES! Like I said above, disable Steam Cloud Saves for this title. Trust me on this one, its not worth it. The game can and will crash AND burn and take Steam down with it nine times out of ten.- Graphics issues may be an issue for some. Personally I'm fine, no issues with framerate or anything, but I know that was a major issue with FFXIII. This game is gorgeous, but it'll make your graphics card sweat it's little electronic balls off.Potential Cons:- Combat system is more or less the same as FFXIII. If you didn't like it in that game, you won't like it here. Not an issue for me, but I know some people complained about the way combat worked in the last game.- Read the Beginner's Guide if you didn't play FFXIII. The game picks up three years after the ending of the last one, so if you didn't play it or didn't finish it (I don't blame you, I liked it but even I'll admit it dragged like hell for a while) then you'll be lost unless you do that.Overall:I honestly feel like this is the kind of game that FFXIII should have been. It takes what that game did right and improves on it, while fixing most if not all of the problems from it. If you have the money, give it a whirl. Even if you skipped FFXIII entirely it's worth trying.",Recommended,

I really love the game, but it sure isn't for everyone. But I want to talk about why you should NOT buy this game until Square Enix finally patches it.I collected data from multiple friends and combined those data with my own experience and general performance reports. The game is a technical mess and does not fit any even slightly modern hardware. It runs very unstable with horrible frame pacing and dropping frames everywhere on pretty much any hardware and runs fully on a single core of your CPU, which leads not only to very strange performance if it works, but it leads to the fact that the game very often just doesn't work on modern PC's with more than 4 CPU cores at all! Furthermore it is really unstable if ran on anything but Windows 7, even the officially supported Windows 8 is a crapshoot.My personal experience:I can't even get past the second ""boss fight"" right at the beginning of the game as it crashes right after every single time, no matter the settings (listed at the end of this review).In conclusion: Final Fantasy XIII-2 has become infamous for being probably one of the worst PC ports in the last 10 years and Square Enix does not care and in fact, they still roll out bad PC ports to this day, like World of Final Fantasy, Nier: Automata or the just recently released Final Fantasy VII Remake, which has barely any grafical settings, horrible frame pacing and frequent stutters. And they want you to pay 70$/80€ for in on top of that! Square Enix has to start respecting their customers, but if people keep buying their broken PC ports they won't have any reason to do so. So please don't buy broken pieces of ♥♥♥♥ like Final Fantasy XIII-2 and rather invest your money in games from studios that actually care about delivering high-quality products.My specs:CPU: Ryzen 9 3900xGPU: Radeon RX 5700XT 8 GB1 TB SanDisk SSD16 GB RAM",Not Recommended,

The game is the second in the Lightning saga. This game is buggy though. WARNING: I installed the 4gb patch which can be found under the sticky post in the community forums. If your experiencing any type of bugs in the game, mainly crashes to desktop of pc, try using this patch. Be aware every pc is different and may not fix your issues. It did fix my issues, for the most part. Sadly, this port is horrible on pc. I recommend playing on a console if you can, but if you do not have access to a console with it on, buy it on sale. Anyways, here is my pro/con list:PROS:NOTE: You will experience bugs, but follow my instructions below and try your game and see if it works if you have any issues. Only install the 4gb after you experienced bugs in the game.- You get to play as lightning's sister, Sarah.- New characters and new enemies.- Continuation of the game from FF 13. I sugggest playing FF 13 first to understand the game, as some of the story plots involve things from the first game in the trilogy.- New mechanics and a new moogle friend.- TIME TRAVELING!- Paradox endings (multiple endings).CONS:- Install the 4gb patch provided under this link:That really saved my game.- Even with the above 4gb patch, you may experience other issues like stuttering during cutscenes. I had this in my game, but only minor ones.I recommend only getting this game if you get the whole trilogy of lightning 13 series games. Also, due to this bad port, you may be required to fix it to actually play it with a 4gb patch. Also, i suggest getting it on sale. It goes on sale quite a bit, so wait to buy it on sale.",Recommended,

Miro Laaksonen,71.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033156135/,"January 16, 2015",62,"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is practically free of the issues that people generally have with XIII, meaning that if you didn't like the original game, there just might be a chance that XIII-2 could still be for you. The game is not linear, the combat system is (slightly) improved, and the game introduces multiple new systems and features, such as Paradigm Pack, traveling through different time periods, multiple unlockable endings, and throwing Moogles around to your heart's content. Traditional world map system is replaced with Historia Crux, a series of connected time gates you can use to access different areas and visit them in different time periods. While the game does re-use multiple areas, most of them feel relatively fresh thanks to visiting them in different time periods. Completionists might also be glad to hear that it is possible to close and reopen these time gates, which allows you to redo any part of the game again after finishing it, meaning that there's no missable content. I found the whole time travel thing a fairly solid system, kind of similar to what Chrono Trigger had.Paradigm battle system is still around, but this time they have introduced some new mechanics, such as Paradigm Pack, which is a system that allows you to capture different monsters you encounter and use them as your third party member. It's kind of like Pokemon, and there's even a fragment that rewards you for catching them all. It is a nice addition to the game as it's adds an extra layer of customization to your party. One other improvement the combat system received was an ability to change your party leader during fights, which I very much welcomed. The difficulty of the game though, compared to FFXIII, was bit low for my taste, but this is partly redeemed by the Coliseum DLC (included with the PC version).The story continues from where Final Fantasy XIII left, except that there's a twist, Lightning is gone. I won't spoil any plot detail,s but I'll give you a brief and vague synopsis of the beginning. If you don't care, feel free to skip this paragraph. The game starts when this guy called Noel (who is from the future) arrives to New Bodhum, meets Serah (Lightning's sister from the original game), and together they set to search Lightning through these time gates, which nobody really knows how they appeared in the first place. (Of course, all this gets explained later and my synopsis is terrible anyway). Of course, this is a Final Fantasy game, and naturally later down the road you find yourself trying to save the world from the villain, who, I must add, is one of the best villains Final Fantasy games have ever had. The story did feel very vague and not particularly interesting in my opinion during the first four chapters (which there is six), but it improves once you reach the fifth chapter.Characterwise Serah and Noel are both decent enough main characters. I didn't find neither of them particularly interesting, but they did the job. At least Serah is, in my opinion, much better main character than Lighting was, whom I simply found incredibly dull. However, one character that really stands out is Caius Ballad, the main villain of the game. Once the story develops, it becomes evident that he actually has a very clear and understandable motive for what he is doing, and for a villain, he actually ends up being really likeable. I didn't personally like the soundtrack of the game very much, but stuff like this is very very subjective, and it seems that there is a great deal of people who really do enjoy it, so your opinion might vary. I'll just say that the game uses lots of vocal tracks, some of which I found actually pretty good, but they just didn't work as background music of a video game very well, in my opinion. Japanese ending song, Yakusoku no Basho, is really good though, and so probably is the English one as it's the same song with different arrangement and singer. One more thing I'd like to point out about the audio side of things is that I didn't really like the sound balance. The sound effects were too loud and background music bit too quiet for my preferences. This of course would not be a problem if the game had audio options, but sadly it doesn't.Unlike FFXIII, XIII-2 has tons of side quests and content you can do, most of which is quite good (damn it all those Oerba puzzles and Academia quizzes...). The PC version also comes with all the DLC (aside from few costumes). Coliseum DLC has series of very difficult battles against few classic Final Fantasy bosses (there's even Ultros!), which offers you a nice end game challenge after you have beaten the base game. Lightning's DLC is kind of a prologue to the sequel Lightning Returns, and then there's Sazh's DLC, which I sadly found to be a waste of time.Okay, a  Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a solid entry to Final Fantasy series. It has some flaws, but overall it's a good game. However, it's definitely not the best Final Fantasy out there, nor is it a good introduction to the series. If you are looking to get into Final Fantasy games and happened to see this in Steam, I'd recommend to start with, say, Final Fantasy IX, VII, or even V or VI first. Still, it's a good game, and I do recommend it if you like JRPGs in general and do want to give newer Final Fantasies a bash. The story is also relatively standalone, so you can play it even if you haven't played Final Fantasy XIII and don't feel like playing that first.One more thing. I said nothing about the PC port because at this point probably everyone knows that it's, well, not very good, and there's tons of other reviews that do that already. If you do happen to for some obscure reason care what I have to say about it, you can check my Final Fantasy XIII review, where I rambled about it somewhat extensively. It's not the same game of course, but the port is almost identical, except that it somehow runs still bit worse than XIII did.",Recommended,

I did that and the only technical issue I ran into was Noel had some wierd chicken legs in a single shot of a single cutscene.Having to manual patch this game aside, this truly stands out as one of the better Final Fantasys, improving on everything its predecessor fell short on. The antagonist took me some time to understand but every time I fought him it truly felt like an exciting mortal combat. The time travel aspect was completely unexpected to me, but it does a good job of keeping it relatively simple. each time period is essentially a level, and the story helps you understand the significance of most eras.Cons? The DLCs are boring. Szazh has a DLC that is just gambling and finding chocobos in a very small level, Snows is just a battle simulator, and the one that hides the ""true"" ending is basically just a challenge battle between lightning and Caius (which to be fair is the most interesting one, I just didn't have the patience to fight one looooong battle over and over again till I won).

And, looking at Steam achievement stat, half of players just quit playing around after the first boss fight.After completed the game myself, I can now understand why. During my playthrough, I also wanted to quit playing several times. But I had to force myself to finish this game, because I know that this is a game that I shall never want to replay.XIII-2 story feel more like a fanfiction of FF13, not something you would expect as a proper sequel.It retcons a lot of what that had been established in original XIII, like story, lore, and characters' personalities.Combat is even more restrictive than original XIII. Your 3rd party member is now replaced with a captured monster. Each monster has its own set of roles and abilities, and you can only switch up to 3 monsters in battle. That means, during paradigm shift, your 3rd party member can only switch, at most, between 3 roles.In original XIII, every party members have access to all 6 roles for paradigm shift.Party member AI is a downgrade from original XIII. My major complaint is that XIII-2 AI always try to move themselves closer to enemies. Oftentimes they just walk right into active enemies' AOE attacks.In original XIII, any party member that caste magic or use projectiles would stay away from enemies so they would be unlikely to get attacked.And they added quick-time event into combat system...Boss fights and special abilities now have big buttons prompts on screen.The port quality of this PC version is abysmal. You will encounter issues regardless of your PC hardware.You might believe that your PC can handle this game. You might believe that high and stable FPS would be easily achievable, because this is a 2014 game, and you have the latest current-year hardware.And you would be dead wrong. It's like this PC port was intentionally designed to withstand technological advancement; to make sure that this game will always run poorly on any PC hardware, past, present, or future.Fluctuated FPS and frequent stutters are common, even with community-made fixes.Also, there is no volume control. And this game music is obnoxiously much louder than dialogues.

I really liked XIII, and XIII-2 gave me some of the continuation I've been craving.  If you were a fan of XIII (Hey, we exist! Don't judge!), you are probably going to get some value out of this game as well.I really like the dynamic and fluid style of battle in the XIII games and I enjoyed returning to it, a good while after I initially played XIII on my PS3.  It is strangely satisfying to watch your characters and monsters get gradually stronger over the course of the game, as well as hunting monsters to tame and figuring out what to do with them.Bad port, not a bad game.  I do cautiously recommend, but perhaps get it for your console instead of Steam if at all possible.  If you do play it on PC, I strongly recommend using your GPU drivers or 3rd party app to cap your framerate to 30 to avoid the wild fluctuations, it does suck but at least you won't get sick.  I also recommend playing with a controller, if you have one.  And if you haven't played XIII yet, definitely start there before you pick this one up. If you don't turn off Steam Cloud Saving for this game you can expect extreme load times and having the game crash to desktop.In closing I want to have it pointed out that a lot of the negative reviews on Steam for this game seems to be because of crash issues, which I'm sure could have resolved in the majority of the cases if they disabled the abovementioned cloud sync.

I've never understood the hate this trilogy gets from the FF fandom and I'm grateful that I played all three before knowing anything about said hate.  I found 13-2, in particular, to be a fantastic game: Caius is a fascinating bad-guy with a motive I couldn't help but sympathize with, and the relationships between Serah and Noel, Serah and Yuel, and Noel and Caius were all interesting to me.

Heartles,72.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heartles_xyz/,"January 14, 2024",26,"It's more fun than XIII. But I liked it less.If FFXIII is a good (if somewhat overproduced) HBO miniseries, FFXIII-2 is the episodic Syfy spinoff show. It looks worse, the writing is worse, the tone is campy instead of serious. But it works pretty well regardless.The game is largely a response to every common complaint about FFXIII. Too linear? Here's a game that constantly branches out! Not being able to swap characters in combat is annoying? Now you can! Too much stuff is missable in the early chapters? Well here's a game about time travel where you can repeat almost anything!!The combat system is generally better than its predecessor. Most of the little quirks that likely bothered you about XIII will be resolved or at least less of an issue. You gain full access to the paradigm system 20 minutes in rather than many hours in. You can switch between the two leads at will (and are forcibly switched when the one you're controlling dies, instead of a game over), with the third combat slot being reserved for one of several monsters you've captured and can use to supplement your arsenal. Leveling is more interesting but also more stressful, you can make permanent mistakes when leveling your character if you don't bother to figure out the new crystarium system, but it also means you have to make choices more interesting than ""what to do first"".Structurally, XIII-2 is a branching tree of vignettes, spread out over a few hundred years of time in universe. You control Serah Farron, her buddy Noel, a combo moogle/sword/bow and your army of pokemon as you jump from place to place, time to time, and timeline to timeline, all in search of Sarah's sister Lightning. The story gets grouped into episodes, which can take place in a single spot or involve you jumping between times to solve whatever paradox is plaguing you this time. It's fun. It's silly. It's the Squenix take on Doctor Who. This lends itself well to side quests, and in fact many non-required episodes are solely a series of side quests. It's actually quite fun.The downsides are that many of these episodes can be played out of order, or even halting an episode partway through to go do something else. This means that it can be easy to lose track of what the deal is with any given episode, and that there can't be any meaningful character development for the two leads. Sarah remains flat and uninteresting throughout, while Noel is kind of hit-or-miss. This isn't helped by how returning characters from FFXIII receive little character development: Lightning is boring and stoic, Snow remains a puppy-dog himbo who doesn't think about the consequences of his actions, while Hope at least gets an offscreen upgrade from grief-saddled teen to successful 20-something academic. Other returning characters make only cameo appearances.The game also sometimes expects you to go back and start searching for all the keys (called ""wild artefacts"") that you missed in previous areas, without giving you any real direction for where to look. This is tremendously frustrating especially when you keep getting pulled away from it by random mob attacks. The game really could've done with a Kingdom Hearts style counter of items still to find in each area, which it does have for fragments, but not for the wild artefacts you need to progress the plot.And then you get to the technical issues. I had to mod my game heavily to keep it from crashing regularly, and even still the performance will just start chugging every once in a while on well capable hardware. It's a truly awful port. All in all I had to install FF13Fix, a 4gig memory patch, the leviathan tears mod to fix raindrops, and then I also installed a mod to unlock the console exclusive outfits (choosing the right outfit for a locale was something I found surprisingly fun, and I wish the game had more choices for winter wear).Ultimately, if you liked XIII with reservations, and are okay with the new tone, you'll probably enjoy this game too.I wrote this review before I finished it, and updated it after the credits rolled.

Everything in this world looks gorgeous. I often found myself just standing still and looking at the scenery in each area. The effects are also fantastic and that is especially obvious during combat.As a standard for the series, the soundtrack is fantastic.  Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Mitsuto Suzuki have managed to blend orchestral music with techno and dubstep and while that may seem like a  recipe for disaster, it's actually glorious. Every track is unique and memorable and the tone of each track perfectly fits the mood of the area or scene it is played at.The story of the game is mostly hit or miss. Some people like it while others think it's needlessly complex. I for one consider this one of the best stories the series has ever had. I never found myself wondering what's going on. Everything, from world events to character motivations, was clear to me from the moment they were revealed. The main objective of the characters, the world mythos and the antagonist's plan are clear.It basically revolves around Serah, the younger sister of the previous game's protagonist, and Noel, a time traveller who arrives at Serah's time to warn her of a dire future.The game picks up 3 years after the events of the previous game. In the prologue we see Lightning fighting a mysterious enemy named Caius, in a realm called Valhalla, to protect the godess Etro, the one who was revealed in the previous game that liberated the l'cie from their cursed brands. Lightning sees Noel emerging from a time gate and asks of him to seek out her sister Serah and gives him a mission which will be revealed later. She assigns a moogle that can turn into a bow, named Mog, to give to Serah, then opens another game for him and proceeds to engage Caius in combat once again, allowing Noel to escape. Later we see a meteor falling in the village of New Bodhum, one of the many human settlements built around the pillar of the crystalised Cocoon, where Serah resides along with the NORA gang, also from the previous game. Soon after, monsters attack and Noel appears just in time to help Serah, giving her the bow to protect herself.After the fight, he reveals to Serah and the NORA members that Lightning told him of weird distortions in time, called Paradoxes, taking place and that these distortions would soon lead to the destruction of the world. He said that Lightning needs Serah to solve these paradoxes in order for her to protect the godess in Valhalla, without specifying how one leads to the other. Noel then reveals that the meteor is a time gate through which the duo, accompanied now by Mog, can travel through time using the Historia Crux, the crossroads of time. In their journey they will learn about Lightning's true mission, the motivation of this mysterious Caius and his connection to Noel and the godess Etro and the reason time is distorted. Along the way they'll meet previous characters like Snow, Hope, Fang and Vanille and new characters, all with their own missions and objectives.There's also a time travelling character, named Chocolina, who is the main vendor of weapons, items and materials in the game. She's basically a merchant who doubles as comic relief.This is a very well written story overall and I enjoyed every second of it.The gameplay is downright flawless this time around.•For the combat, the game uses and expands upon the previous game's battle system, the paradigm system.The paradigm system utilizes the ATB aspect of previous titles in the series but allows you to use multiple commands. •Each character has access to every role and it's up to the player to switch between roles during battle. The player controls only one character during battle, the leader, but you can swap leaders mid-fight, enabling some interesting strategies. There's also an auto-battle command which will automatically select which abilities the character you control will use, depending on their role and the situation they're in. New to this system is the option to choose whether you want your characters to focus on a single target or utilize multi-target spells when using the auto-battle command, allowing for more freedom and customisation. As a result, the battles are faster but strategy is essential to defeat the tougher enemies in the game.There are 6 roles available for combat. Commando (DPS), Ravager (Mage), Synergist (Buff), Saboteur (Debuff), Medic (Healer) and Sentinel (Tank)•The character progression utilizes the Crystarium system of FF 13 but expands upon it. Each crystarium stage consists of a linear set of nodes, some small and some large. The player chooses which role to level up by using Crystarium Points (CP) and the available node in the Crystarium stage. Small nodes will offer general stat boosts but large nodes will offer large boosts according to the role you chose to upgrade. For example, using a large node to level up the commando role will give a large Attack power boost etc. This allows for a lot of customisation but caution is obligatory since you can essentially lock a character out of certain stat boosts depending on how you use the large nodes, leaving them under-developed as a result.•There are 2 playable characters and 3 slots for recruitable monsters. The monsters start off weaker than the characters but you can upgrade them using monster materials which work like CP works for the main characters. Later on you will learn about monster infusion and hidden monster abilities, which will allow you to infuse monsters with other monsters, giving them their abilities and allowing you to create the ultimate monster. This is by far the best feature in the game because it allow total freedom in how you want to develop your monsters and the results are always satisfying.•New to the series is the accessory capacity. Serah and Noel can equip accessories to boost their stats and gain resistances to certain elements or debuffs. However, unlike the previous game, accessories now take up an amount of ""space"" on a character. This means that if, for example, an item takes up 60 points of capacity but Serah only has 20 available, she can't equip it. The capacity of each character starts of low but can increase as you level up using CP and completing crystarium stages. It caps at 100. In order to use all 4 equipment slots, you will need to customise the items you have  in the shop to make them smaller but weaker or just use them as is and carry less. Sometimes it's preferred to use 4 smaller items than 2 or 3 bigger ones but this depends on the player.The main story isn't the focus of the game. You'll find yourself spending more time doing side-quests this time around. Each location has available side-quests for you to complete in order to gain CP, items or fragments which are basically the most important collectible in the game and can be used to unlock special abilities later in the game. Certain areas consist entirely of side-quests and can be unlocked using Wild Artefacts (used to open optional time gates) and have their own side-plot. There's also various mini puzzles to complete and a casino area in which you can use slot machines, assign tamed chocobos in races for items and money, unlock special abilities using Fragments and later on play Poker and a fun game called chrono bind.In addition to that, there's a ton of optional bosses and after the final boss, you will be able to replay missions and fight tougher versions of old bosses to unlock alternative ""paradox"" endings.You might also find monster infusion fun depending on how much you enjoy customisation and item farming. Grinding isn't required but it's recommended.",Recommended,

This game was a ton of fun, and was both similar enough to the original ff13 while being different enough to make it a fun new experience. The game is broken down into smaller chunks in the form of visiting different locations from the original FF13, but in different time periods, which essentially end up being levels for you to explore. Each level will contain a main story objective to work through in order to advance the story (or side-stories), as well as list of various tasks that earn you ""fragments"" which can kinda be viewed like collecting stars in super mario 64. Some of these are simple fetch quests, while others will have you defeat a more challenging enemy, but despite some of the simplicity in these tasks, it never really became boring for me. I had fun time travelling and completing various tasks.The story was an excellent direct follow up for Final Fantasy 13, despite using time travel as the crutch for being able to pull the story in so many different directions.

The game has possibly the best writing I've seen for a time-travel story, and wonderfully expands on the universe established in XIII.Two technical notes: * For those experiencing crashing, you can disable steam cloud for this game.  * For those experiencing low frame-rate on NVIDIA cards (I'm on a GTX 1070 Ti), you can enable the following three settings in the latest NVIDIA drivers to speed up the FFXIII renderer: (i) Threaded Optimization:On, (ii) Triple Buffering:On, and (iii) Vertical Sync:Fast.",Recommended,
Carrionjr,70.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Carrionjr/,"November 24, 2020",23,"Final Fantasy 13 2 continues the Square-Enix’s run of terrible ports, with this one being worse than Final Fantasy 13’s which I didn’t think was possible. This time around it not just bad porting (buttons are hard mapped to the keyboard even when using a controller, have to use keyboard to exit game) that you have to worry about, there are also ground breaking bugs that cause constant crashes to the desktop to deal with if you don’t perform a few google searches first. This is a crying shame, as being the direct sequel to FF13 it boasts much improved game mechanics, a more focused story with characters that are enjoyable to follow, less character management and an easier crafting system. It’s a great game to play, marred by the fact that it was ported in the last 5 years and still being riddled with game breaking bugs that require a few fixes to make things workable.You don’t need to play the previous entry to get a rough catch up of previous events (there is a very quick review available in the main menu), however you would be doing yourself a major disservice by not finishing the first entry before starting this one. The game starts during the previous games ending, and focuses on quickly introducing a raft of new background lore which drives the entire story. Without spoiling the story, Sarah (Lightning’s sister) and Noel (a human from 700 years in the future) embark on a time traveling journey to bring lightning back to existence and resolve a host of time paradoxes as she has been written out of reality due to someone trying to change the events of the past. The first ½ hour is confusing, but unlike the previous game it gets much clearer after that and stays enjoyable right to the end. I loved the concept of the future changing the past (so it aligns with the past, preventing grandfather paradoxes) which is something that’s not often explored in games that deal with time. Because the game only focuses on Sarah and Noel, the story isn’t anywhere as disjointed as the previous entry.This also translates into much improved gameplay as you are only focusing on 2 characters that are always in the party, with the third slot being monsters you can capture and raise which is the biggest change compared to the previous entry. Each monster is locked to its class, but can have other monsters infused into it to get abilities it wouldn’t usually be able to receive. While you can ignore this function in the game if you want (just levelling up the 3 monsters you can have in your team at the same time is enough to finish the game), this system does allow you to create some outrageous combos that truly buff your team. Also upgrading characters is much easier with a singular job tree rather than a separate 6 to manage, with CP being much easier to come by (there isn’t a need to grind in this game). Bonuses when levelling up jobs are locked to extra strength, magic or life, and are applied based on each crystal size (the bigger crystals give more, and the bonuses differ based on what class is upgraded). This makes it quite easy to plan ahead to make the characters much stronger than what they would be if you just dump points randomly. Monsters are fed other monster drops to upgrade a set stat. It also removed the annoying crafting system of the first game, a weapons strength and magic are now fixed. While the jobs stay the same as FF13, you unlock all jobs fairly early in the game so you get a lot more use out of the paradigm system. After the previous games linear path, FF13 2 is mostly a free for all, go anywhere you want affair. The story is structured around resolving time paradoxes that have arisen, but there are a ton of side quests and different time periods that are available to explore. To open a lot of these side areas you are required to thoroughly explore each area and complete side quests, many which span across different time lines. Many of the objects are hidden exceedingly well, you could spend hours looking so using a guide might be recommended for some quests or exploring some areas. There are a few quests that require in-depth knowledge of not only this game, but the previous entry that require a guide to finish. You also have the option of go to a casino and play on the slots or chocobo racing to mix things up.Visually the looks great much like its predecessor, though there are less areas to explore. Because the game revolves around visiting the same areas in different times (or alternate realities) each area can look different, but it cuts down on the total amount of areas to explore. This game is set entirely on Gran-Pulse, with some new cities and places outside the flow of time. Each area can be revisited at any point (with main story events being replayed from the start or continuing from where you previously left an area), though each area/time will contain many secrets and different enemies. Most of the assets have been reused from the previous games, with only a few newer characters being introduced. You now have the option of changing your outfit and adding accessories. There are plenty of in game movie sequences, however they don’t outstay their welcome and do propel the story forward. To mix things up there are a lot of QTE events during battles and movie sequences, which can help you end fights quicker if you succeed in them.The voice acting is still excellent, though they dropped the Australian accents of the people of pulse- (Fang and Vanille still have their accents). Having the previous characters play bit roles wasn’t too bad, and the scripts for them were a lot better this time around. There is a lot less whingeing and crying this time around by Hope, as well as a lot less angst by the remaining cast, which makes it much more enjoyable to listen to. The music is outstanding, with a mix of full vocal as well as different styles. There is one heavy metal fight song (it reminds me of DMC series), as well as a wild chocobo which I will miss listening to. As mentioned before the bugs are ground breaking, but can be fixed. Without doing anything I found the game constantly crashed when changing camera views (which happens at the end of battle). I fixed this by running a 3rd party patch which increases the amount of RAM it can use. This stopped the crashes, but sometimes enemies wouldn’t display. I had to turn off Steam cloud saves to resolve that, and the game has been fine since. You shouldn’t have to put up with these errors for a AAA release, but at least you can fix them.The 3 DLC’s are included and explain what Snow, Lightning and Sazh are doing. All 3 become available after the main game is finished and reward you with extra monster summons (in the shape of the listed characters or other well know characters from the FF series. I would only bother with the lightning one, as it’s a canonical ending, taking a few hours to finish the fight. Sazh’s one has you focusing on playing poker, while Snow has you fighting in the coliseum against some well know characters from other FF games..If you are wanting to 100% the game, it’s a much easier task this time around. You level up much quicker, and only a few of the fights right at the end will prove to be difficult with a fully upgraded party. One quests will require fighting one enemy at least once, which is where most of the time will be spent end game.For more reviews please visit",Recommended,

That being said, simply disabling the steam cloud saves makes the game a lot more stable. I managed to get through the entire main story with only 2 crashes in my 50 hours of playing, which yeah it isn't even good having a single crash, but the game was more than playable without lag or stuttering.Stability aside, the game easily gets an 8/10 from me. I've been trying really hard to branch out into RPG games that have longer stories with multiple endings and this game is perfect for that. It has so many little details and a large world to explore compared to the previous game. Honestly, I've enjoyed it so much and enjoy the side-stories so much that I'm trying to 100% the game with all trophies if that says anything about how good the game actually is. The graphics even hold up quite well for a game thats over 10 years old.If you've already played 13 and want to see what comes next, 13-2 is definitely the next best step and corrects so many of the flaws that people complained about with the previous game, so long as you disable the cloud-save system that steam setup, the game runs perfectly fine otherwise.",Recommended,

stohre.stories,90.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stohrestories/,"June 13, 2021",36,"To be clear, I absolutely DO recommend the game Final Fantasy XIII-2.  However, I wouldn't recommend playing it on the PC if you own a console.  This port is garbage.  The fact that Square Enix doesn't even care that they've released a garbage version of a great Final Fantasy title baffles me.  This game has been out for years and they've never even attempted to solve the myriad of problems with this game.  First of all, it won't even start after installing until you've done some research on how to mod it.  Once that issue is solved, you will be dealing with framerate drops literally down to 0 every time you load a new location, and every time you move into an explored area, and almost every time a battle begins.  It chugs and chugs and chugs and chugs until it eventually crashes.  Back to the modding drawing board.  After modding it some more to fix those issues, are they fixed?  No.  They are not fixed.  They are just better to the point that you can play it if you're okay with being incredibly frustrated the whole time and yelling at your screen.  I had to scale the resolution back to 1080 and the frame-rates to 30 for it to be worth my time at all.  And even then, it chugged a lot.  If I wasn't such a big fan of FFXIII and excited to play Lightning Returns, I would've demanded a refund.  But I wanted to see the whole story, and here we are.  That said, there is a lot to love about the game.  It's a cool time-travel story and concept.  Serah and Noel make for better main characters than I thought they would.  And Mog brings some laughs to a story that can get pretty dark.  If you see all the endings, you will watch the end of the world many times.  I really do highly recommend playing this if you've played XIII and want to see the story through to the end.  I'm about to start up Lightning Returns with fingers crossed that the software itself is as good as the game this time.  FFXIII had similar issues, but I hit the recommend ""thumbs up"" on my review because after modding it, it ran just fine.  The fact that this game is not salvageable with the robust modding community and the fact that Square hasn't fixed that after all these years is reprehensible.

FelixIG15,79.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/felixig15/,"June 29, 2019",22,"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a sequel to the original FFXIII, an underrated game with a storyline which people find confusing, FFXIII Trilogy is the main part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Mythology. While many claim that the game should have ended in the first place, a part of me simply disagree. XIII-2 adds a lot of interesting plot, twists and events, and one of the best villain in the Final Fantasy franchise, Caius Ballad.XIII-2 distorts the ending to the original XIII with more involvement and storytelling of the Lore involving Etro and the Gods behind the scenes in the XIII universe.XIII-2 uses a really dangerous theme which is Time Travel, which of course will confuse the hell out of people. Time travel in XIII-2 is a bit different though to the conventional time travel which the player will learn overtime throughout the game.The world is diverse, open (yes, it's more open than the linear hallway-like map in XIII), and there are a lot of sidequests and hidden treasures to be found! In short, it's opposite to the original XIII map which is nice! :DCombat System is improved from XIII's Combat System by A LOT.XIII-2 also doesn't disappoint in terms of music (Paradox and Wish is my favorite OST from the game)The only thing i don't like about this game is how short the main story is.Overall, if you don't like the first game, give the second game a chance.",Recommended,

The first ff 13 is bad but it's playable and the Lightning Returns runs perfectly, without any changes in the game or in the settings.But, is this game playable? It is, after you aply some patches.For the crashes you actualy don't need do disable the Steam Cloud, just search on google for the 4 GB patch, this fixed the crash issue for me.To optmize the framerate, search on google for the framerate patch, before this patch i was getting most of the time 20 fps, after I am able to get above 30 fps, but i lock at 30 with rivatuner (because the radeon setting not working, idk why), so i can get a more stable experience. And if you don't use something to lock the fps, like rivatuner or your gpu settings,at 30/60, the game will freeze because it will try to create as many frames as possible, so be aware.My pc settings are: fx-6300 + rx 550. And the only options that's seen to work in my tests, on the radeon, is setting the V-sync to always off and the Triple buffering On.A last advice, even after patching the game it will still drop frames sometimes (when there's too much effects or when changing areas), especially if you don't have a good pc, but when compared before the patch the game is 100% better. So, after you have done all the changes, disable the fps counter and try to focus in the game and forget about the performance.",Recommended,

This is a direct sequel and you will be lost if you skip the 1 game. If you take FF13 1 as an extreme linear game with for the time breath taking cutscene feeling like a action Micheal Bay movie. Here you get a more gameplay focus and emotional focus game, but still a linear game but with moderate size zones.The game now had random encounters, and you have monster that you can level, you can get new monsters from killing the random encounter. It feels like a soft version of Pokemon. And you will probably stick with your team until the end of the game and only change it, if you try to do optional post game content.The skill system is worse than FF13 in my opinion you lose almost all control of your Crystarium, you can go really deep with the new one but you need Excel spreadsheets and you can easily finish the game with just levelling up your most played class section.To the story it's a classic 2010 melodramatic story with many dialogues like ""never lose hope"", ""we stand together until..."" if you have played FF13 you know how the characters talk in this game. But the story itself is like the first game confusing but on a fundamental level extremely easy to understand you basically get the point in the mid of the game. If I am full honest the story could be told in 15 hours but the game is without grinding 35-40 hours long.In the end a game really playable in 2022 you get mods for controller buttons online the graphic is still really good, good voice acting, fine story. 6.5 out of 10.-if you need fragments to continue the story just google it or your run could go double the time your choice.",Recommended,

Borrows the same mechanics as its predesscor Final Fantast XIII which was a fantastic game.  The story is amazing and you will enjoy playing through this game.   The port is however pretty lousy as always from these remakes.  One major flaw though with the game is that you MUST MUST disable steam cloud sync in properties for this game if you want to get rid of crashes to desktop.  This is not the only required fix needed to enjoy this game from start to finish which is ridiclously the developers have not fixed this but you must also copy across d3d9.dll from   C:\Windows\System32 TO  DRIVENAME:\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY XIII-2\ then paste in d3d9.dll and then the game will work flawlessy without a hitch.

Let me tell you how my complete playtime went....my only session with this PC version of the game:1. Boot up the game. I guess because I didn't have my controller on at the time it only registered my keyboard. So for the one and only session the icons became stuck on the keyboard icons. Why. I replayed FF13 here on PC just earlier this year and it had no problems switching between icons. Okay. Whatever. Not a big deal. Except there are QTEs in the beginning of the game so good luck with that. You can't change it because you can't save beforehand. I could have just started over but I didn't care that much. I'm very low maintenance. I'll just change it next time. That is what I told myself.2. The frame rate. Dipping and spiking. And in a jarring way. I'm not a picky person when it comes to frame rate.

The plot is engaging and intuitive. The characters have their depth and motivation. The storyline is somewhat linear as expected but has extra choices and secrets to be explored. Yes, the game really has technical issues at first including stutter and force-close but by pluging-in game-controller and disable steam-cloud save, all issues are gone and the game run smoothly with current average PC spec (I use Ryzen 3 with 1050ti).In conclusion, if you are the fan of FINAL FANTASY and already play FINAL FANTASY® XIII, there is no reason why you should skip FINAL FANTASY® XIII-2.And for the first-timer of FINAL FANTASY universe, go play FINAL FANTASY® XIII. It's not the best but far from the worst in my opinion. Then if you somewhat like it, FINAL FANTASY® XIII-2 will make you love this triology more.By the way, if you live in Asia and want an English soundtrack instead of only Japanese, go buy the game in Square Enix Store website (US or UK), and use the code to add the game to Steam.

But I'd rather have a poor port that can be fixed in less than 10 minutes with community patches, than no port at all. That's why this isn't an immediate thumbs down for me.The game itself more than makes up for it, and it's a game I 100% recommend even if you didn't like 13, no, ESPECIALLY if you didn't like 13. The developers listened and fixed every issue that the community had, and with a considerably lower budget too. You're given way more freedom from the very beginning, stats development is entirely up to you and how you want to play.You can like time travel plotlines more or less, but this one is made in a very compelling way, everything makes sense, no plotholes that I'm aware of which is a big issue with these kinds of narratives, and they get you hooked up from the very beginning. Returning characters (especially Snow) get a chance to prove they're more than the cringy basic personality they were given in the first game, Caius is a fantastic antagonist, and Noel's story is one of my favorites ever. There's no more ""Walking in corridors for 20 hours until you get to the good part"", a bunch of optional areas to just go and ""I wonder what happened 200 years into the future in here"". The music is outstanding as it was in 13, but this soundtrack is more varied too. You also get the chance to use monsters as teammates just like in 10-2, I think that's pretty neat instead of having just 2 members, and adds even more variety to the game.The negatives would be that graphically it's not as impressive as 13, but honestly I care little about that. And also the game is way more self-contained, areas are generally smaller, you won't find an Archylte Steppe from 13, but also map designs like Palumpolum or Bresha Lake which are a straight line were also completely discarded.I can't recommend this game enough, loved almost everything about it",Recommended,

Cpt. Moist Panties,124.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/,"March 13, 2015",39,"I'm convinced this game is a work of satire. The plot is so contrived you stop halfway and realize that Square is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with you.Here's an example: there's a machine in the past that kills its creator and creates a future filled with robots. What caused it to kill its creators? Itself in the future corrupted the machine in the past to kill its creators. Why? Because if it didn't force the machine to kill its creators in the past it wouldn't exist in the future as the sole controller of the world. The Machine came from a future that didn't exist so that it could continue existing and create that future. Someone wrote that and thought it wasn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid and self-contradictory. The game deals with time-travel and 'paradoxes', and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does it ♥♥♥♥ on the time-travel concept with so much confusion it can only be considered a work of satire. There's also something about a girl who has a title passed down the ages, only that each girl who gets the title looks exactly the same as the previous one. Hey, at least it explains why the protagonists at the end of FFXIII didn't turn to crystal after completing their focus. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does it fill the explenation (which is quite simple) with a ton of confusion.Dumbass plot aside, the game is a huge step up from FFXIII. Sure, it obviously didn't have the same budget as FFXIII, which becomes REALLY obvious when you 'unlock' the same map over 4 times with minor alterations (dark, daytime, piss filter, piss filter but with red orbs around the map). Assets from the previous game are also reused, like Oerba village and a ton of music from the previous game. But even though this is essentially FFXIII 1.5 it still winds up being miles better and more enjoyable. Two reasons for that:1.) Exploration. The Historia Crux is basically a glorified menu where you select what location to go to. When you go to a location, you'll have two tasks: find artefacts and fragments in the map and talk to people to take up tasks to receive artefacts and fragments. Each map has either 1 gate or more which are unlocked with artefacts, while fragments give you documents to read (if you dont care about the game world then tough ♥♥♥♥). Unlocking a gate unlocks another location to travel to in the Historia Crux. Here's the good thing, though: the artefact required to unlock that gate might not even be in that map. It might be in a different map which is unlocked in the story or through a gate in a different map. For example. a woman wants to find her glasses, but its dark in the gameworld due to an eclipse so you won't be able to get them. You WILL be able to get her glasses when you unlock the alternate version of that map where an eclipse ISN'T occuring. Get her glasses there, then go back to where there's an eclipse and give her her glasses. In the Historia Crux you'll see how many fragments are in each map and how many gates there are. So you'll be skipping from map to map to map collecting artefacts and fragments and going back to previous maps to fulfil requests. Dude wants some sort of PC equipment? You get it in some tech facility in a different map. If it sounds like you'll have to keep up and make note of everything, don't. The best thing to do, really, is to take up requests when you can and just collect all fragments in a map, which come in boxes. Hell, I collected all fragments I could before finishing up chapter 5, and then proceeded to finish it and already had the fragments needed to proceed, which I didn't know I would need. If the idea of exploring maps for items and jumping from area to area is appealing, you'll love this.2.) CustomizationYour third party member is a monster, the same ones you fight in battle. After battle there's a chance you'll ''collect'' one of the monsters you killed. Once collected,  you level him up in the crystarium just as you would level up. It gets a little difficult levelling up monsters at later levels since the materials needed are scarcer, but not all monsters reach their peak that late. Some do so much earlier, and you can sacrifice them to pass on skills to other monsters. The customization and levelling in your third partner presents a level up system that is more in-depth than even the main cast. and that's about it. It's not hard to be a better game than FFXIII, and this game isn't outstanding since it really plays more like a side-game. Like a handheld title in a series that frequently appears on consoles. It's not the typical Final Fantasy experience in that its production values aren't as high. Like I said, this is like FFXIII 1.5. But that's not a bad thing. The game manages to be an enjoyable modern day FF title and an all-around good waste of time. They should've fixed up the ridiculous plot and put the money they put into FFXIII into this one.",Recommended,

Daimonic,76.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/daimonicg/,"January 5, 2022",14,"The direct sequel to 2009’s Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIII-2 brings a slate of improvements to the flawed formula of its predecessor, from improved exploration to the non existence of a 20 hour tutorial, to the way you encounter enemies, while perhaps taking a hit in other aspects but overall it should be said that XIII-2 does surpass XIII and it also unveils the actual mythos behind the Fabula Nova Crystallis.While very similar to XIII it does bring some quality of life improvements, finally being able to change party leaders during enemy encounters which leads to not losing battles when your party leader is downed despite the two other members being alive, which was in my opinion a flaw of XIII and a departure from classic Final Fantasy. The level design, while still somewhat linear, does lead to more exploration and choices while walking around, it clearly is a step up from XIII, but it continues the linearity the franchise has had since Final Fantasy X. In a myriad of ways XIII-2 does mirror X-2, it has a similar level “selector”, the Historia Crux mirrors the Celsius, such as being able to visit every biome that existed in the previous games in a non linear form, while both predecessors you walked the world in a linear progression following the party’s journey to their destiny.Speaking more in depth about the changes to combat, the paradigm pack is a nice addiction with a somewhat Pokemon style system, that is to say, during the game you may catch crystals that contain the monsters that you defeated and they may help you in battle, and each monster has a given role attributed to them that is immutable, you level their crystarium with components that you either randomly gain during battles or chests during the game or buy them through the shop system in XIII-2, there are various tiers of components for each type of beast, be they robot or l’cie or biological and as Pokemon have EV’s (read: Effort Value) which are mutable characteristics. There’s also an infusion system in the game, that I did not delve much into, but to summarise it, you infuse a given beast with the crystal of another’s so that they may gain said beast’s passive ability.The last thing about gameplay should be the Crystarium, while in this game we still use a Crystarium it has changed to be less linear, you do not have 6 paths for each character, you only follow 1 path that has 22 stages, and that are not gate kept by your progress in the main journey unlike XIII’s, in this iteration of the Crystarium each role is attributed a level that goes up to level 99, each role favours a stat, be it strength, magic or HP, and when you level a role you get a bonus for the stat that said role favours, usually Serah is the Magic User while Noel is the Attack User, you may only focus on Commando for example and leave every role at level 1, there is absolutely no restrictions, and if you do end up levelling a role to 99 in early Crystarium Stages, it costs little, because the CP costs are tied to the Crystarium’s stages not the the level of the role you are levelling.Final Fantasy XIII was the first one to be released under the umbrella of the Fabula Nova Crystallis, but while XIII deals with theme of defying destiny and focuses on Crystals such as early entries in the franchise, it doesn’t delve much into the mythos of the Goddess Etro that the cancelled Versus XIII was supposed to deal with right from the get go.As with the gameplay the initial setup for this game also mirrors X-2’s setup, in the fact that each of their predecessors doesn’t foreshadow a sequel or has an emerging intrigue starting in their ending, neither does either one need a sequel, both games reach conclusive endings on their own without the need for a follow up, which leaves the setup for both feeling maybe forced and unnecessary, nonetheless both games bring interesting gameplay and are worth the play.The game starts 3 year after XIII’s events, which is dubbed 003 AF (After the Fall [of Cocoon]), Serah is living in what is called New Bodhum in Gran Pulse which is populated by the familiar faces that lived in the original one, but we soon learn that shortly after XIII’s ending, Lightning disappears mysteriously, and suddenly monsters appear in the town and with them comes a strange fellow called Noel that says he arrived there from Valhalla where he found Lightning protecting the Goddess Etro’s throne, and he informs Serah that to reach Valhalla and save her sister they must journey through time fixing paradoxes.The game introduces us to Valhalla to the Goddess Etro and to broader themes of the Fabula, but does it so in a way that sometimes can feel disconnected from the original game, the characters may suffer less characterization given the more non linear progression of the story, that was one of the upsides to XIII’s linearity and some of the supposed emotional scenes may come out as cheap same with some of the plot twists but overall XIII-2 tells a decent enough humanist story with the overall theme of the Fabula, that is defying destiny or dying trying.Similarly to its predecessor the OST of this game is decent enough, there are some songs that are quite well, one that strikes me the first time that I heard it was the one in the seaside in one of the more advance levels, but for the seasoned Final Fantasy fan it doesn’t come close to the legendary OST of past entries made by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu.The original endgame of this game rubbed me in a way more positive light versus the endgame of XIII, it was way less grindy and the fragment list was actually fulfilling to complete unlike the trapezohedron grind of the previous game, although the hardest bosses either played exactly like the previous one or very similarly, but that point ends up being fixed with one of the DLCs.There are a few DLCs, I’ve read that Square Enix’s DLC practice for this game (and others for that matter) was quite consumer unfriendly but for the Steam version everything comes with this purchase.Some of these DLCs are spoiler heavy and so will be my review about them.Sazh’s Story: Heads or Tails? The objective and gameplay is quite dull, the synopsis for this story is that Sazh’s son has disappeared and for him to recover his son he must play poker at the universal casino, when translating this concept to execution it really ends up being a really boring DLC, and its plot implications are simply to explain how Sazh appears at the end of the game to help out Serah and the crew.Snow’s Story: Perpetual Battlefield This DLC is the one that can really satiate the more hardcore players with it’s fights, you find yourself in an universal omnitemporal colosseum where you fight various enemies from XIII’s universe or related to common Final Fantasy mythos, and a SPECIAL appearance from Ultros ( a Final Fantasy VI classic).Lightning’s Story: Requiem of the GoddessThis DLC and the secret ending that you acquire after getting 160/160 fragments is the one that connects XIII-2 to Lightning Returns, something that should have been done to connect XIII to XIII-2. The gameplay for this is somewhat fun, it requires you to fight Caius and lose enough times until you become strong enough to beat him and witness the ending of the DLC.Overall this game is a step up from its prequel, and while XIII is overly criticised in Final Fantasy circles this game helps clear this trilogy’s reputation for those that dare to play it.Also this port requires you to fix it cause Square Enix, for that follow this useful guide:",Recommended,

hassanyawar,90.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yawars/,"June 15, 2021",17,"So playing this game right after Final Fantasy XIII, gives a quite clear idea what Square Enix wanted from this game. They initially tried something new in Final Fantasy XIII, in which some things were appreciated but some were heavily criticised. They took all those good things of initial game and evolved it and tried to address the issues gameplay design wise in this sequel.First I'm going to talk about the port itself. Overall pc port is mediocre at its best in vanilla form. A lot of people in past have complained about crashes and FPS drops. To resolve or at least to minimise those issue I would suggest going to , this has safe links to fan made patches and mods that tries to restore the game. For me after these patches, my gameplay experience was quite enjoyable with only one crash in whole run. Overall FPS was good as well.Instead of being linear like previous instalment, the sequel gives you multiple areas to explore and travel back and forth as much as you like. This game introduces random encounters again with a slight modified form which I personally liked a lot. Battle system is more responsive and with paradigm shifts animations taking a lot less time to change now. One party leader dying the game does not over but instead the control of the game shifts to the other surviving character. This game only has two playable characters. We can also add third party member as well but that will one of the monsters which we catch while during random encounters. Yes, it also has monster capture elements. The crystarium has also been upgraded. Instead of predefined upgrade nodes we can select the type of stat upgrade we want on the node. To sum up, the gameplay experience has definitely been refined in this game.Story of this game is about time travel and it can get a little confusing. The story overall takes places in multiple areas in multiple time eras, with time era having its own minor lore. I found protagonist Serah exactly opposite of Lightning, where Lightning was brooding with emotional layer hidden deep within, Sarah is a little bubbly and polite with slight emotional layer on the top. The villain in this game actually feels like a powerful and destructive being which I liked a lot. Overall characters are well defined in this game.The soundtrack is awesome. Simple enough.This is a good sequel and I would recommend to play this if you finished and liked Final Fantasy XIII. Even if you didn't liked part 1 enough still give this game a try.

It's non linear, has puzzles, lots of minigames, and tons of side quests. There are tons of monsters to recruit into your party, and it can get a bit addictive. Some are infusion fodder, and some are great on their own. The trick is knowing which is which.The story is much more interesting than XIII as well. The main characters have much more depth and I find myself caring way more about Caius and Noel's stories than anything that was in XIII. Caius is the best kind of villain - one who thinks what he's doing is right.Now for the bad:The only problem I had with the game is that it's too easy to gimp your characters if you don't know what you're doing. The game doesn't tell you anything about the leveling mechanic. Doing it right makes a huge difference, but basically you want Noel to have all of his strength bonuses on the big nodes and all of Serah's magic bonuses on her big nodes.The port is decent.

Bud8013,0.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bub8013/,"June 16, 2023",12,"This is a review for those who are interested in the Final Fantasy XIII series (ON PC) :Final Fantasy XIII-2 is considered one of my favorite games of all-time (ON PS3), and it still reminds me even after finishing the series as a whole. From the music, to the characters, to the progression as a whole, to the semi-linear structure of the whole event, this experience has stuck with me for maybe years (ON PS3). To explain, I played FF XIII-2 FIRST without even knowing it's name due to how young I was stupidly enough. I ALMOST beat the game before my PS3 was stolen and sold for a addiction a family member had, and I never managed to beat it till I became a young adult. After putting the time and money together, I bought the entire series of FF XIII to play (ON PS3). And traveled through it's world. FF XIII was a beautiful and musical masterpiece <AS A MOVIE> but as a game, it is super slow and tiring. Plus due to my experience of playing the second game first, a lot of events that happen just got me angry or confused (Example with Lighting Punching a specific character and just thinking Lighting was just a bad character from XIII due to my thoughts from XIII-2, which is shocking to see what she is later.) (P.S. I HATE FANG PERIOD but Vanille gets a pass due to who is overall is despite common thoughts. ) Overall, XIII was a great movie to watch but a terrible game to play. FF XIII-2 doesn't need much explaining of my opinions and with the context of the first game even having a shorten verison in the game really shows what is in store for you. However, with the addition of FF XIII-3, the ending kinda causes a weird ""Paradox"" to happen due to future events.FF XIII-3 was... INTERESTING. From a story standpoint, it wraps this up and entire pulls the sheet off the table and causes everything on it to fall and break. The game even pulls the ""And the world was turned into Earth and maybe the friends along the way may still be alive"" bullcrap the game says. I did enjoy the story bits that expanded what left. The Gameplay however is so different and strange that it was slapping someone in the face. And the system would evolve to help develop future games down the line, but here it just feels werid. Plus the game is also built around an always online system with a lot of mechanics surrounding it and made my experience feel off (ON PS3). Overall, it is interesting to say the least.Overall, the FF XIII series was amazing for what it brought and what it gave (ON PS3). However, the PC ports of the three games seem to be REALLY BAD. While it seems FF XIII works fine, FF XIII-2 REQUIRES Heavy outside support to even RUN. Plus even with the use of the Patches, it could even not run at all. However, if you can experience this series first-hand and for the first time, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND watching a Movie-based gameplay video on youtube of FF XIII due to it's problems but then playing XIII-2 & 3 to experience the wonder of this game.FF XIII-2 will forever remain in my heart as one of the most important games in my life and my most favorite game of all time.",Recommended,

The whole “let's save Lightning” angle felt forced from the start. I would have taken a game where we play as Lightning the whole way thr- Oh, right, that's what Lightning Returns is about. Anyway, a lot of plot points and major story elements felt forced or like they didn't belong. This didn't hold it back all the time, but it could have done far better.=Art 9/10=On the PC, this game is absolutely stunning. When you throw all the settings up to max and optimise your graphics settings, you end up with a game that is so beautiful you sometimes forget you're playing a game. Admittedly a lot of people have complained about FPS issues, but I felt that the way it was solved in FFXIII (Editing general graphics settings through my Nvidia Control Panel) solved the issue for me before it even became one. The game played in 60 fps steadily throughout the entire playthrough. If you're having problems, Google around and try to fix it before complaining. It's worth it.=Sound 10/10=Music and Final Fantasy are synonymous terms for me. Whenever I play any of the FF games, the soundtrack is the first thing I listen out for. What sort of instruments are we leaning towards? What sort of feel does this game want to give me? Every boss fight is unique, every average fight is energetic and every area has a theme that suits it perfectly. I've listened to the FFXIII-2 soundtrack more than enough times as I do other things to know how much I love it.=Characters 7/10=Admittedly the weakest point of this entire game is its character lineup. Why Serah? Why Noel? Why do I care about them? A lot of the twists towards the end felt both forced and pointless. The Goddess Etro wasn't even introduced in FFXIII and now I'm supposed to believe she's a big thing that's a big part of everyone's lives? No one else seems to know who she is, so it feels a little stupid. Whatever, it's no big deal. I would have rather focused on Hope and thrown a boomerang around, to be completely honest.=Gameplay 9/10=I don't like the way prior FF games handled combat. Sue me. FFVII was absolutely trash with the Materia system. FFVIII's Draw system was only marginally better. FFXIII's system made it so that some characters were only viable because they had skills others didn't. FFXIII-2's Crystarium does the same thing as FFXIII, but makes good on a few faults from its predecessor. Haste and Slow aren't casual abilities to throw around now, which were absolutely broken prior. Your bonuses from stacking multiple Roles into a Paradigm is better, meaning that swapping to 3 SEN's is now a really smart move whenever you see a charge up attack. This game involves more thinking than most people care to admit. For that, I salute you, FFXIII-2. For the record, playing with Keyboard and Mouse is so easy that it's criminal.=Overall 8.5/10=FFXIII-2 is worth the $20. By far. I got 50 hours out of this and I played the hell out of it originally, so I was already on top of where everything was and what I needed to do. A newcomer could easily spend an extra 30 hours and not feel like it's forcing you to grind or do anything you don't really want to. Even if you played the game prior, it offers a new experience to what you might be used to. Definite recommendation from me.",Recommended,
H,13.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Anub1sR0cks/,"December 22, 2014",70,"Square released a patch today which actually  some DLC from the game. The performance remains unchanged.Buyer beware.The resolution selection does nothing but change the window size while the game is still rendered in 1280x720, making everything blurry unless you have a monitor running natively at 720p (which few modern computer users do). The framerate jumps wildly from 60 to well under 15 almost arbitrarily.The problem lies in the fact that both FFXIII and FFXIII-2 for PC are  multi-threaded applications when virtually 99% of software written today is. This is an artifact from when Square ported these two games over from the Playstation 3, which had an extremely complicated and poorly designed CPU architecture. To minimize writing code (perhaps due to time constraints or inexperience, or both), Square decided to throw the entire game on a single thread.Regardless,  in this case. You could try running this game on a 486 or Cray Supercomputer and you would probably achieve the same results. Kidding aside, this port is  poorly optimized.",Not Recommended,

Kron,61.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/weloveaspect/,"July 16, 2023",13,"Still one of my favourite Final Fantasies ever, top 5 for me for sure.It's got some of my most beloved characters, one of the best villains, an absolutely phenomenal OST, a REALLY good story (if you're into one filled with Time Travel, Paradoxes etc, lots of stuff like that), tons of open zone areas to explore that are surprisingly pretty big considering the platforms this originally released on and to top it off one of the best combat systems in FF history, the combat is a wildly improved version of the Paradigm system from FF13 that just feels super satisfying to play with in all aspects.Then throwing in the 150+ monsters you can get to add to your party definitely makes the updated combat feel even greater too. You can mix and match any 3 Monsters at once with the same or different roles/jobs to spice up your builds, but that isn't the best part... the best thing about the Monsters in this game is the borderline infinite customisation they provide, you can upgrade Monsters basically any way you want with a wide range of materials and as they level they'll unlock specific skills and abilities which you can infuse into any other Monster to create the perfect being.Now unfortunately by default the PC port for this game like FF13 is not great at all, without the correct fixes you'll be stuck ranging from 30-45FPS and that for most people won't feel good to play. However there are a mountain of guides that fix this (I've been running the game at a perfect 60FPS no problem even in the more graphically intense areas of the game) so if you're on edge about buying it because of all the tech issues don't worry, they ALL can be fixed and extremely easily. That of course doesn't take away from the fact that normally it is a bad port though, I don't know why Square keeps doing this but hey at least it's fixable and not just DOA.I'd also recommend going for all the mods and enhancements you find in the guide presented below, like the HD mod, button prompt fix, 4gb Patch and so on, they will definitely be worth your time.Link to the guide I used that fixed my game - As a final thought I hope more people decide to give this and the rest of the games in the FF13 trilogy a try despite the bad rep they got on release, they're all so good and get so much blind hate now that it's sad. Plus of course this is a sequel to 13 anyway so playing this one before that doesn't really make too much sense and jumping in without any knowledge of the first game will leave you confused for most of the playthrough, lot's of context to specific things comes from playing the first game. BUT there is neat feature on the main menu that explains parts of each of FF13's chapters to fill you in, it's not as good as actually playing through the game but having a lore tab for the first game in case you're new to the series is really nice.So yeah there's so much more about the game that I love that I didn't mention above mainly because spoilers (if people even care about that now) and also because it would take WAY too long to share my love for this game haha. With everything considered though this game is a solid 9/10 for me, not many Final Fantasy's make me feel the way this game does... it's just so perfect and packed full of content.",Recommended,
Sugar Banana 0 Coco,130.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mayoaddict3/,"August 28, 2018",16,"I played most of the final fantasy games since when I was young, before FFX10 and FFVIII came to steam. I used to play them in a very old Windows XP and a Windows 7 computer. Back then those games was always refreshing and broke the usual norms held by video games. I always wanted to play FFXIII series- it was a dream to me. Regardless of course I jumped to FFXIII-2 without playing the prequel for various reasons. I did saw a lot of videos related to FFXIII and I could say it’s more epic than this. But, I think it was a bit too much when people say that FFXIII-2 is bad compared to most Final Fantasy games. In terms of bugs, FFXIII-2 is indeed bad and frustrating. But you have to understand this is a badly ported game and I never let that bothered me really. There are many workarounds for the bugs and some worked for me. With that said, I managed to get all of the achievements (most were ridiculous), completed the DLC and the main story and my judgment is the story is epic. Since the bugs were bad I’d first start the review with that.The bugs for me did not happen overnight, it happened when I was a little bit into the game (up to Bresha ruins for the first time) and crashed when I was riding the chocobo. There were glitches in saving sometimes and that sucked. When taking screenshots the game would crash a lot. I felt like the steam overlay is insanely slow when I was in the game too. The fix what worked for me is mostly running the game using the Nvidia processor (rather than the onboard which is since it’s a laptop pc users won’t have probs) and making the game play in the windowed mode. Also taking breaks from time to time helped too- memory tweaking such as increasing the UserVA could be done to allocate more memory to the game if you want (this was the fix that works 200% of the time). But no matter what- it was really hard to enjoy the game when there is an immense FPS drop. There were many ways to tweak this in the forums but ofc I did not follow the methods because of the fear that the game would break… more.. The story is totally related to the first final fantasy game, and it continues from there. Lighting is fighting in a place called Valhalla, Noel comes from the future, and Lighting asks him to get help from her Sister. And Serah takes the job. However, you are supposed to travel timelines to different periods and eras to go through the full story. The story also involves the farseers of padra, who are like the messengers of goddess Etro and the guardians who protect them. The game is a mental relief for people who were obsessed with FFXIII since the characters from that version appears here. This story has several endings depending on the fragments you collect. Collect all 160 fragments and you can get a secret ending, the version I bought had the DLC also and that includes the real ending in a side story after the main final battle is done. I never really liked Serah’s character much, but you have to admit that she has a noble personality Lightning was fascinating putting a strong upfront always. This is Noel’s game for me since he seems more powerful, more headfast, straightforward and strong. Most of my friends know that I was literally obsessed with Noel and it was not strange because it was his personality that helped me through the dark times. The villain himself could not be characterized as a villain since if you take his point of view you can justify him. The most loved characters for some players, such as Hope Esthiem seems really cool and interesting. The chemistry between the characters are great, especially Noel and Serah. I don’t care what anyone says, but Serah is more fitting for Noel than anyone else. Snow seems too uh big for Serah idk. Compared to the old FF games the battle actions have initially changed a lot I noticed. But I found that more realistic and challenging so it was great. I missed using the guardian forces though- but taming monsters and fusing them seems so creative. Battle paradigms were a total new thing to me, but I really liked it! There were some unfair battles here and there but the usage of the fragment skills made everything easier. To keep it short and sweet I will name some of the unique features*You can play casino and get nice prizes*Chocobo races in casino requires you to have a high level chocobo to win*Fragment skills get unlocked when you collect fragments of each time portal and it has stuff like earning more CP, monster crystals*Choices are important in the game dialogues. Replaying each level with a specific fragment skill would trigger hard boss fights and may unlock a different ending (paradox endings)*Hard monsters which have very rare dropout rates for precious items- getting the ultima weapon is quite hard. *Very nice side quests that requires some work. *Time travelling- each location might have multiple time portals so finding fragments for one location can depend on another.*Closing time portals and replaying levels to get different endings*When the commando and ravager roles are maxed you get two powers each for Noel and Serah (they are cool)*Staggering and chain making seems interesting and creative.*The dialogues the bystanders say are so funny LOL*Chocobocolina is here to sell you some awesome goods. Also I’m not sure if it was the part of DLC but Sazh’s side story is pursued later in the game in the casino place.Technically, I also loved the battle moves and I never depend much on items except wound potions. But I really missed skills such as casting Aura by myself because such features are attributed to the monsters in this game. Leveling up seems kind of nice since it’s separated for each role. Also just because you have leveled up doesn’t mean that you get the max strength you need good weapons and accessories. I didn’t like the limited capacity for the accessories but oh well. I like changing the outfits but I hoped there were more outfits for both Serah and Noel, Mog of course had many. The DLC content have a side story for Lightning which includes the real secret ending- the battle itself is very hard unless you max out lightning. You should get a five star rating battle result to get into the second half of the fight which is harder and slower than the first one. The fights in the colossiuem could be unlocked if you have the DLC which is kinda interesting. You can unlock the opponents you fight and level them up in the crystarium. It was pleasures to beat Omega and Lightning in the colossieum.I expect the weapons available in the shops higher than the ultima weapons are from the DLC as well. As usual FF games never fail to disappoint me in creating stunning visuals which are breathtaking. Every battle I fight is so satisfying just because of that. Every main character looks like some kind of a god like deity lol. The landscapes are stunning especially academia. The music is good but I prefer the music in FFXIII better. Also the designing of clothes and weapons seems so fascinating and intricate. The names of the weapons are also very unique- it’s close to my culture and I can understand the meaning of the names. Some achievements here seem a lot tougher to get and frustrating. Clockstopper requires you to get 100 preemptive strikes without break. The lucky coin fragment which you can get from the casino by playing slots is also mighty hard to take. Players have to tape the *tab* button on the keyboard and wait for hours to get it- but I don’t think that works. I had to go into super victory mode and then take the game by myself and I randomly got it- it actually requires luck that gameplay. Saddlesore and getting all the monsters for the fragments is time consuming.It's a nice RPG overall, but the bugs can kill you so be aware of it. Epic story and gameplay though.",Recommended,

All the gameplay related qualms one might have with the first game are sufficiently squashed in this game. Party leader can faint, combat opens up earlier, there are more places to explore, there's some nice post-game stuffs, etc... The paradigm/stagger system is still the most underrated combat system in the series that's infinitely hindered by the words ""auto-battle."" It's the most kinetic and engaging version of rock paper scissors in gaming, and that can be fun too. The story doesn't really pick up so naturally from the last game, nor does it follow its own rules of time travel. But I'd be hard pressed to say that the story is a mess or hard to follow (common critiques). It's actually very easy to follow and contains a pretty good cast of characters. Whether the original 13 party should have been shafted in favor of the new characters we focus on is a discussion unrelated to the quality of the game itself. The music? Outstanding... except for that one rap song wtf was that.It's a hard recommend but an overall thumbs up because an the greatest hurdle into this game is finishing 13 itself.

Theta_Zero,106.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Theta_Zero/,"March 3, 2018",13,"Updated review for 2021.From a story and gameplay perspective, this is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games, and my top pick in the FFXIII trilogy.  You can re-explore various areas at different points of time, recruit monsters as allies, and there's a ton of DLC and side-story content to explore outside the main game.  On the subject of allies, the system gets really complex, allowing you to not only level up monsters, but also combine them to absorb certain abilities into certain other monsters.  It's surprisingly complex and something I really like about this game.There are two key negatives that led to a negative overall review: DLC and technical.On the DLC side, some of the original DLC is completely absent, notably a few costumes and most of the weapons.  Additionally, the story DLC has been moved from Chapter 2 to Post-game.  I don't necessarilly dislike this change, but it does take away content that was previously available.From a technical view, the game crashes a lot.  Turns out the game only allocates itself 2GB of RAM, but sometimes needs more.  Whenever this happens, the game crashes.  This can be fixed with community patches, but hasn't received any formal patch to address it.  Similarly, you can’t select your display monitor on a multi-monitor display, and you’re limited to 720p and 1080p (no 1440p or 4k support) when in Windowed mode.Ultimately the console experience for this game is just a better one, and this port fell short.",Not Recommended,

Some may say this is not a good ""2nd"" game of the series. But I personally think the story extended smartly and it is actually interesting. I like the development and game mechanic that they don't change too much but it is not completely the same as FFXIII, so game play still seems fresh, but familiar. You can look up some game play demo on Youtube and you will see why.The port control is as the same as FFXIII in the sense that you don't really need gamepad to play and keyboard + mouse control are implement perfectly (at least for me). Never once I though ""oh I wish I have gamepad"" and never once I feel awkward while using keyboard+mouse to play. (very easy to get used to)About game crashes.....

oscaronez,76.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/oscaronez/,"November 20, 2016",12,"If you like playing games where you can explore a beautifully crafted world with a proper story behind it, then you will enjoy FF XIII-2. You feel like you are really getting to know Serah and Noel throughout the game's main story. There's plenty of supplementary action, chatacter-building and lore to learn in the side quests as well.Whilst you couldn't really class it as a sandbox environment, there's still a bit of room for exploration and as mentioned, lots to do aside from the main story. While it may be a sequel to FF XIII, it is not necessary to have played that game first as FF XIII-2 stands fine on its own. You are suitably filled in on the events in the previous game.The music is very wide ranging in its style but there are some truly spellbinding moments where you can clearly tell a lot of thought has gone into the creative process and the team behind the game have worked together to create instances where you are seemingly locked into a moment in time; a fitting counterpoint to all the travelling through the Historia Crux that you do during the game.The gameplay itself isn't particularly exciting in my opinion. It can get quite repetitive but there's lots of room for variety in your approach to battles with the various paradigm packs and monsters, but I get the impression that for the creators of FF XIII-2, the gameplay itself is arguably one of the lesser important elements.After spending 50+ hours on the game, I have come to the conclusion that FF XIII-2, at its core, isn't about grinding monsters and attaining level 99 in everything. You can by all means grind away, and many players will end up doing this if they are struggling with a particular boss battle so that they can advance in the game and find out the next chapter of the story and enrich their view of the world(s) that FF XIII-2 takes place in. Because that's what this game is about. Telling a story and building world full of rich detail and history for this story to take place in.Caveat: the port is a bit buggy such that you will almost definitely have to actively take action to change some settings on your PC to ensure you can reliably run the game without any major issues.",Recommended,
FFXIV Addict,60.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dorrai/,"December 12, 2014",35,"Writing this review after 6 hours into re-playing on the PC version.Storyline and gameplay-wise it is a great improvement compared to the first one.They somewhat fixed the ""linearity"" which was a problem in FFXIII. The game is a bit more open-world but still pretty straight forward in terms of traveling, etc. It is definitely, however, not a straight lined map with no town/NPC interactions. They also did a really good job (in my opinion) with the storyline that is still a bit confusing but not as bad as the first one. Keep in mind that the store page is somewhat misleading as they only show you screenshots of Lightning but the main character in this game is Serah and the new character Noel.Graphics and performance-wise it is a bit disappointing but I don't believe it is detrimental to the gameplay. I have an i7-2600k GTX 770 OC and 8 GB of RAM and I frequently have frame drops to below 30. I believe people with a much higher-end PC experience the same problem if not worse. The game still requires patching and optimization so if you are looking for a drastic change in performance compared to the first one I don't recommend you buy it just yet. They allow you to change the game resolution and shadow resolution. I don't really have much knowledge whether the in-game resolution is set to native 1080p but to me it just looks like a stretched out 720p when I set it to 1080p (I could be wrong).

Lightning Returns had a small patch very recently, but they straight up don't care about fixing this port. If anything this is more like a crashing simulator than an actual FF game. When you try to launch the game, it acts like it flips a coin to see if you are even allowed to play it. You have a very high chance to crash whenever you get to a cutscene or an auto save location, specifically using the Historia Crux. For anyone who tries to play this I strongly recommend doing the following:1)  , in the start up menu for the game, it straight up says that saving may take awhile due to cloud saves, I think they confused taking awhile with crashing. This should be done before starting a save, if you want to do it after, simply make a back up of your save file, located at and move it to , create the folders if you need to.2) , 3) , Disabling cloud saves and installing the mod and patch stopped most crashes from occurring, they still happen but its very infrequent.

Twili,69.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TwiliSailor/,"April 15, 2019",10,"In many ways, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a great sequel. Intending to fix many of the issues that fans had with the original game. Combat is refined, with more reward for experimentation. The non-linear approach also fits the narrative of a time travelling adventure well. Creating a larger sense of player freedom. It isn't as impressive or grandeur as XIII but ends up being a more enjoyable game overall.The art-style still looks beautiful to this day, and the score is utterly magnificent. If there is one thing the XIII series can't be faulted for it's the ability to evoke an emotion or atmosphere so readily with its soundtrack. However, the narrative is told awfully. Almost all the dialogue is expository and honestly, does a bad job at explaining what is happening regardless. While the linear design of the original game allowed for such a rich world to be built, and I'm sure the intermittent nature of this sequel meant story would have less focus. There is no excuse for how blatantly poor the game is at conveying its own plot.If it was left just up to this; Final Fantasy XIII-2 would be an easy recommendation for fans of XIII and the franchise. Unfortunately, this port is awful. While the first game definitely had its issues, they are magnified in this release. Stuttering, freezing, bad optimisation and severe instances of crashing in a game that already had a particularly bad auto-save are frustrations that make this by far the worst platform to play on. Sadly, these issues are quite common in many of Square's releases to PC, and the main reason why review scores of this game on steam are so low. Until such problems are fixed (). I can't recommend this. These issues go far beyond what is acceptable and ruin what is otherwise, a very good RPG.",Not Recommended,

Something that FFXIII surely missed on, being a linear adventure. FFXIII-2 gives you so much freedom that its' story suffers for it. This game allows you to visit many locations in different time periods, and even to restart them whenever you feel like it. In fact, there is so much freedom that it compelled me to almost 100% it, not counting a few achievements, while I wanted to be done with XIII as soon as possible. There's also a Pokemon-esque/SMT aspect to it, giving you another huge layer of freedom when building up your third member of the party.Story-wise, it's a little disjointed and chaotic. You have to really think about it in order to truly understand the storyline, as you have to jump through time a lot. Due to the time-travelling nature of the game, you WILL understand the main plot, but will probably miss out on a lot of background detail and worldbuilding due to the way it's presented to you.The characters are an improvement over XIII. While I liked XIII's characters, generally there are some issues there with some, especially Vanille and Snow (though, as another side-note, I believe Snow is fine, solely due to the fact that he is a TANK. And a TANK should be crazy, reckless and willing to jump into a pit of demons just to protect his party). Serah is a reserved and logical person, while Noel is the slightly more rash of the two. However, they both make no dumb decisions and are very relatable. Noel in particular is a really likable character. The main villain is a tragic character, if you can look past his over the top design, he has an interesting, unique underlying motivation and his theme is absolutely dope.Speaking of the villain's theme - the music here is amazing. I don't know what type of a earless, billie eilish listening imbecile you have to be to not enjoy the magnificent soundtracks in Final Fantasy games. This one is no exception. It does, along with the rest of the games in the Lightning saga, feature a more electronic take, and FFXIII-2 in particular even uses a lot of vocal tracks, which give it a unique feel and perfectly builds up the apocalyptic/techno-fantasy landscapes. I especially enjoy the Oerba/Dying World themes.I could gush over this thing even more, but I doubt anyone read this far anyway. The point stands - this is an excellent game, and a very wrongfully judged one. It has flaws, rarely anything doesn't, but it manages to take the theme of FFXIII, and rebuild it into a thoroughly open, enjoyable experience with an unforgettable techno-fantasy adventure.TL;DR: open, beautiful, atmospheric and an overall epic adventure full of very interesting takes on time-travel. This is the Terminator 2 to the FFXIII's Terminator.",Recommended,

Chicony,23.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chic0ny/,"December 27, 2014",23,"The biggest issue I've had this time isn't the linearity of the game, but the PC port. I consider my computer as very good, yet I've had few problems. The most annoying one would be the lack of 7.1 surround sound support, and I didn't find a way to at least make it work with my Razer headset. Video stutter in cutscenes is still there and there are few locations where I've had lower FPS than I'm ok with.The story yet again feels as an interactive anime world, truly well written and astoundingly presented. It felt a bit shattered at first, but that's the part of ""don't lead the way for the players too much"". Plus, if you are fan of time travelling and consequences of changing things in the past/future, you may love this one.Character progress is more ""free"" aswell. And I don't think you can actually develop your characters so badly you won't be able to finish the game. If you don't grind a lot, it will be hard, though. I've spent a lot of time in final battles that were also close to death, it wasn't just about not enough damage.The battle system was slightly improved. Ok, it's nearly the same, BUT. There is one big BUT for me - the pre-emptive strike finally does not start an hour-long animation of hitting every little enemy, instead, it's like one quick Blitz attack and that's it!I was missing characters, though. From the start to the end, you'll be forced to play with Noel and Serah (yeah, and the Mog) + some monster Serah is able to capture. And also cinematics. There really is only the opening and ending, everything else are just regular cutscenes, I think.But well, I don't think this game was as good as the first one (story-wise), because it didn't have that much touching moments, but it's still Final Fantasy.

CheckYou want streamlined Chrystarium and Role Development?

You can capture monsters as you fight them and add them to your party once captured.

Yet here I am, loving the gameplay, looking forward to seeing what's coming up in the plot, pursuing every achievement just as I did in XIII, and able to say nothing but how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a port job this is. The graphics are no higher-end than its predecessor, yet I get half the framerate. The overlay doesn't show up for a good while after the button's pressed, some times for up to several minutes. On windowed mode, the window will continuously lock itself into being active even when you alt-tab away, leaving the program you switched to on top it but holding your cursor down on the exact center of your monitor, with your inputs affecting both simultaneously. Look forward to either fiddling with the game's menus until it switches back, or trying to close it on Task Manager without being able to use your mouse.On fullscreen, the game can refuse to close altogether, not acknowledging a press of the escape key (which is supposed to open the menu to close it,) not acknowledging alt-tab or shift-tab, and not allowing you to open Task Manager, thus forcing you to either power off your device or crash the game by unplugging your display.The N7 armor and Assassin's Robe DLC couldn't be licensed to be carried over. Annoying, but excusable. The weapon and accessory DLCs were also not ported over. Not as excusable. Look forward to having to mod this content back in to the game yourself.

Herald of Fire,27.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeraldOfFire/,"March 6, 2020",12,"This game is very polarizing for me. I gave it a thumbs up, but it's borderline. Where do I start? I guess the first place to start is with your main characters. Rather than following the heroes from the first game, you're stuck with the wallflower Serah and a new face, Noel. That's it. No additions to your party members, no changes to your roster. You're stuck with these two for the entire ordeal. This wouldn't be a problem if they had some personality, but they're sadly about as bland as cheap rice crackers.The combat system is recycled from the first game. The first problem some of you might've noticed is that this really doesn't work well with only two members in your team, so who gets to fill the third slot? Serah, lacking any kind of prior combat experience, inexplicably gains the power to recruit monsters to the team and becomes an instant warrioress the instant she's given a bow. To match her new combat prowess her outfit is magically transformed overnight as well. Because, why not?Okay, so the characters are a boring and the combat has become Pokemon lite-edition but surely the storyline keeps things ticking right? Wrong. The storyline is a mess. Instead of a continuation of the original, we get time travel. This basically gave SE free rein to destroy established canon whenever they wanted since rewriting history is basically the entire plot of the game.During some parts of the game you can choose dialogue options to get some exposition and ask questions. These don't really do much, although you're rewarded with items based on your responses. I personally hate Noel, so lamented the fact that none of the choices allowed me to treat him with the contempt he deserved. Noel acting almost like a love rival for Snow doesn't help to make him very likeable either, and you're stuck with him for the whole game.Okay, so it sounds like a rather scathing review all said and told, so why the thumbs up? Simply because when you set aside the plot and the characters, you get to the gameplay and it actually does this well. The monster system, while ridiculous, is actually well fleshed out and meaningful. Each one can be levelled individually and you can even customize their appearance thanks to 'adornments'. The areas are lively and interesting and as dumb as throwing a moogle sounds, it adds a mechanic which allows you to collect distant items which enables Square-Enix to hide secrets around the maps.The gameplay is actually really GOOD, and that's why it deserves a thumbs up even if the overall plot and characters are less than stellar. Also, throwing a moogle into Noel's face at full force is surprisingly theraputic sometimes.",Recommended,

Akki,14.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AkioMitsuko/,"March 29, 2016",19,"TL;DR - If you want to play Lightning Returns and want to know about the story beforehand, I recommend skipping this broken game and reading a summary instead.I have three big qualms about this game. One involving the PC port, the other two involving the gameplay and its story.Firstly about the PC port: It is HORRIBLY BAD optimized. And I'm saying this after they had plenty of time patching the game but it seems this is as good as they're gonna make it. The game runs on a very, very weird dynamic fps capping system that generally limits your framerate very low so it doesn't spike, sometimes far lower than what you consider okay to look at. The community has found a way to remove this framerate limiter, greatly increasing the potential fps you will have. However, this will cause audio and animation during cutscenes to go out of sync if the framerate drops below 60, making most of them ridiculously stupid if they happen in a performance intense area.Secondly, the gameplay. I've never been fond of XIII's Active Time Battle system, which frankly hasn't changed very much in this game, making this already a minus. What's more is that most of the time it feels like you're fighting unnecessary encounters partly unrelated to the situation. The whole time-travelling system is also very confusing and annoying to do, gating you from progressing by having to go back and finding wild artifacts or other keys in order to progress through the main story. I suppose this was an attempt to go away from XIII's linear world but it's not better at all, making it more annoying if anything.And lastly, the story. If you enjoyed the story of FFXIII then you probably won't feel at home here. Apart from starting off somewhere near the ending of XIII and sharing its characters, it's like a fan-made alternative universe. While I understand that time travelling is playing a major role in this, it feels very disconnected from XIII. The character relations aren't reflective of XIII either, seperating it even more from being a sequel to XIII.On top of all that, Lightning Returns almost nullifies everything that happened in XIII-2 and just starts off from an almost completely unrelated universe. The only thing the 3 XIII games have in common are characters and modifications of its ATB system.",Not Recommended,

So head to the forums to get those ! Make sure to get the frame pacer remover to improve the frame drops. Lock the game at 30 fps if you can't hold 60 for a smooth gameplay experience. 3) This isn't exactly a ""sequel"" to XIII, the story is unique and does its own thing, while some characters make cameos, only Hope and Lightning have major roles. Knowledge of XIII isn't needed but there is a recap on the main menu if you need to get caught up.4) This game adresses a ton of issues the first XIII had.You are in control of the narration, there is a lot of exploration, npcs to talk to, the time travel mechanic and story is super refreshing, especially if you enjoyed Chrono Trigger. The gameplay is fun. The two new main characters are compelling.

I personally remember when this Game first came out on Xbox 360 & PS3 and after playing the first FFXIII I bought this one as the Crystal Edition. Now almost 3 years later it finally came to PC.First of all let me say that this Game does have horrible fps drops and sometimes in some areas you will experience 30fps instead of 60fps.Performance wise the first FFXIII Game was alot better on PC then this one. But let me tell you that the Third and Final Part of this series runs even smoother then the first part!In this Game unlike the first Game you can only play 2 Characters which are Serah Farron and new Character that hasn't been in the previous Game.The Fightning System has also changed a little, not just in layout but also as to how it works. Once again you have Paradigmas but this time you will be able to tame Monsters / Enemies and let them fight by your side! Each of the Monsters come with their own Role that you can level up with Monster Material.The Leveling for the Characters is such the Same as before. Once again you have the Crystarium and the CP (Crystarium Points), with the only difference that the Crystarium looks a bit different and it seems to take longer with more points then before to level up your characters.Unlike the First Game you can now explore a bit more Freely and can get up to 8 alternative Endings. With 1 of course being the main ending. Once you've unlocked all 8 differend Endings you will get a Secret Ending as well.What makes this Game on PC better then on Console? The Fact that we got almost all DLC for free (besides 2 Costumes or so but you can mod them if you really want to)The Free DlC's include some Story DLC's and also some Costumes. So once you finished the Main Game there is actually alot more to do to catch the full Story!Although this Game has its Problems, once you get passed them it is a beautiful sequence to the First Game in the Series and up to this day one of my favourite ones.

jek_the_snek,33.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198448769367/,"January 16, 2023",8,"Does this game improve and innovate on the mechanics of the first game? Yes.Is it at times one of the most simultaneously epic yet solemn final fantasy games ever? Also yes.Is it a better game than the original ff13? Perhaps.(Possible spoilers for ff13 and ff13-2 ahead)First off, this game exponentially adds to the lore and mythos of the twin worlds of cocoon and pulse but in doing so, dampens the sacrifice that took place at the end of ff13. When the game starts we are introduced to the driving force of the first game’s narrative and lighting’s sister, Serah Farron, who has been living on pulse in the town of new bodum. Shortly after awakening from a dream about her now long missing sister lightning fighting someone at the end of time, a time paradox opens (yes it’s one of THOSE stories) and the town is attacked by futuristic monsters and Serah meets up with 2 new characters, noel and mog. The story of the game then centres around Serah and Noel fighting and closing time paradoxes in an attempt to prevent the now crystalline cocoon from crashing down and ushering in the end of the world. Overall the story is intriguing and well written in regard to tackling the main themes of despair, loneliness and sacrificing the many in order to save the ones you love, if not a bit short. On the topic of gameplay, the paradigm system from ff13 has been greatly overhauled. Now, opposed to 3 party members that change based on the story, there are only 2 permanent party members (Serah and Noel) and the other party slot is occupied by any of 3 creatures you’ve captured in battle (think less pokemon and more persona as it is 100% luck based) who occupies a single paradigm. This was a novel inclusion as it makes party compositions feel more unique as you have access to almost every basic enemy to add to your party, train and customise with humorous attire but despite this, does not make up for not having a third CHARACTER in the party as all the dialogue tends to be between Serah, Noel and mog (who is practically useless gameplay wise other than for completionist purposes). Overall the lack of a wider party really sells Serah’s excitement for reuniting with Snow (who also went missing) and Noels sense of loneliness being the last person alive in the end of time. Combat wasn’t the only thing that was changed as the chrystarium was also completely overhauled. This time, rather than progress being tied to story events, a new chrystarium would unlock as soon as the old one was completed. This made progression feel a lot more fast paced and less like it was intrinsically tied to the plot. Paradigms also received some updates as now the SEN paradigm negates more damage than in ff13 and this feature is made apparent from the very start. This leads to combat being more fast paced but also more challenging in places. One final change to the gameplay formula is that random encounters are back but work on a system more akin to persona 3 than to a traditional final fantasy game, where an enemy randomly spawns, you have the chance to attack first to gain an advantage or flee and if you get hit by the enemy, you start with a disadvantage. Honestly I prefer this system as it means preemptive strikes are far easier to get as you aren’t sat in the gapra whitewood waiting for that bastard behemoth to turn around just for the chance of a preemptive strike! Not to mention that now you can change the party leader mid fight so now the annoying death of a party leader, leading to the loss of a fight in ff13 is replaced by the death of a party member, nothing more, nothing less.For the most part, the changes to the gameplay are welcome additions in my eyes and help to make the combat more enjoyable and engaging. The level design has also been altered for this sequel. This time around, Square really took the criticism of ff13’s corridor levels to heart and as a consequence, the levels and the way they are connected feel way too open. This seems like a good idea but now rather than being stuck at the end of a corridor, you actually took 27 wrong turns and have gone through 3 different time zones only to find out through a decade old youtube guide that you went through the wrong time portal and went several millennia in the wrong direction. As for the area design, that is a completely different story. Final Fantasy XII-2 continues to hold the bar set by its predecessor and in some instances surpasses it, conveying not only the state of the world to the player but also the emotions of the characters, using the contrast of the same area being perfectly fine in one timeline and utterly demolished in another to sell the urgency of saving cocoon and its inhabitants.As a result of your time tampering, not only do you save the many lives of cocoon, but you also get a glimpse into the more personal effects of your actions with the character of Alyssa Zaielle, who you witness grappling with the knowledge that they themselves are a time paradox and should have died, if not for the player altering time. Now for the real reason anyone would play a final fantasy game. The villain. Caius Ballad is the eternal sworn protector of yuel the seeress who is continually fated to die at approximately 15 years old. Understandably, this leaves Caius distraught as the one person he loves dearest is ripped from him prematurely, leaving countless iterations of him alone. Caius acts as a foil to Noel as they are both people confronted with immense loss but the way they handle it is completely different, as where Noel sees hope and is seen as a light in the dark, Caius seeks only chaos and destruction. On the topic of chaos, I would like to discuss this game’s implications on the wider story of the ff13 universe. With the end if ff13, you see the entire party, save fang I believe, transform into ceith, then to shortly later revert back into people. Ff13-2 tries to explain this by introducing the unseen character of Etro, the goddess of death, who it turns out took pity upon the party and used her powers to revert the party. This caused a time paradox which was resolved by lightning being sacrificed and imprisoned by the chaos until the end of time in valhalla, which in turn led to the death of Etro, whose heart (the heart of chaos) is stored inside Caius. This is an interesting addition to the lore as it shows that there are beings above the likes of the fal cie who possess the power to rewrite history. As none of this was referenced in the first game, this makes it feels less planned and more like a slapdash effort, especially with bunevelze’s introduction in lighting returns.After numerous fights with Caius and saving the population of cocoon, the game’s climax takes place as a battle against Caius in valhalla at the end of time. This leads to either Noel killing Caius or his suicide based on the player’s choice. This then leads to the heart of chaos being shattered, setting the events of lightning returns into motion.Like it’s predecessor, this game has excellent music with a large selection of high energy tracks as well as loads of more typical final fantasy music, with each area having an alternate version of the song for when an enemy appears and tries to attack you, which helps sell the sense of upcoming action with the next fight. Like with the area design, the ost also contains some more sombre tracks which succeed with selling the emotion of the comparatively darker story.Overall while this review was fairly positive in its tone, I would like to add that there are flaws with the game. The actual story is relatively simple and more of a vessel for the interesting themes and during the latter half the game becomes extremely TEDIOUS as in without a guide this game would be over 75 hours long levels of tedious. It also ends on a cliffhanger that only serves as a way to sell lighting returns which I won’t get into. but if you liked ff13, you should like tis game.",Recommended,

This game ( along with a patch that came out with FF13 ) has graphics options.The following are the graphics options in the game:Resolution - You can set this to your native res. If you're running Nvidia's DSR or AMD's VSR, you can select a higher res if you have that enabled. I have AMD's VSR enabled and am able to choose 1800p ( 3200x1800 )Shadow resolution - This setting goes from 512x512 to 8192x8192 ( !! )Anti-aliasing (MSAA) - This setting goes from x2 to x16Sound Settings - Japanese or EnglishThat's all the graphics options. It's not much, but it's a vast improvement over the initial release of FF13.Now, on to FPS - Unfortunately, it looks like the HUD is still causing the FPS to drop to 30 like in FF13, meaning battles still drop from 60 to 30. I'm hoping they will fix this, but for now I just play through it like I did with FF13.",Recommended,
pepsimanvsjoe,51.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/,"December 20, 2014",19,"Despite the best efforts of Lightning and her crew, the world is once again in danger. Now it's up to Serah, mysterious traveler Noel, and moogling Mog to make things right. Despite putting 50+ hours into FFXIII-2, I'm about as equipped to discuss the plot as somebody who has never even heard of the game....or Final Fantasy. I guess this title could be compared to previous Square games like Chrono Trigger & Chrono Cross. The player must pass through various times and dimensions, alleviating paradoxes, fighting monsters, and getting pushed around by some jerk named Caius. There are dark moments (like Chrono), but it sticks to 3-4 characters, instead of attempting to juggle 300 (like Cross). I guess that's part of what got me through this game. When the story doesn't make a lot of sense, at least you can watch the friendship between Noel & Serah grow, and realize that they're getting by despite the heaps of BS being tossed their way.The battle-system is straight outta FFXIII, but with numerous changes. The most obvious is that the third party member is always a monster. Pocket Monster fans are going to find dozens of creatures to recruit throughout their journey. Monsters are strengthened via materials, and can be infused with others to gain additional skills. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed that monsters adhere to the FFXIII system. For example, I recruited a Giant Cactaur, but he's not going around using 100,000 needles on everything. He's a synergist so he sticks entirely to buffs.  I know I know, the paradigms are essential to winning in FFXIII, but I just...oh well. On the bright side, monsters tend to have unique skills that make them more effective in a given situation than Serah & Noel. On the whole, FFXIII-2 is a fair bit easier than its predecessor. This is mostly due to the fact that you're actually not limited in how much you can grind. Since this game is non-linear, you could go to various optional areas and amass a ton of levels, making the story-battles trivial. Aside from a handful of post-game & DLC fights, you'll have to limit yourself if you want a challenge.Speaking of levels, the Crystarium got a convoluted revamp. You cash in points for stat bonuses: +3 to magic, +20 to HP, etc. Over time you unlock and level all six roles, but your level 99 stats can vary. There's a ""perfect"" guide floating around to help you figure this mess out. While I ended up using guides to have a chance at 100%ing this game, I merely stuck to leveling what I thought would make sense. For Serah, I leveled Ravager on the large nodes to boost her magic, and with Noel, commando. I probably goofed somewhere and cost myself a good 30+ points in an essential stat, but I've done most everything in the game, so it isn't that much of an issue.In order to get all 160 fragments, you're going to be doing a lot of exploring, grinding, puzzles, and stupid pet tricks. Mog is capable of finding hidden items, and can also be thrown to reach faraway objects (which you might need a guide to find). The puzzles are almost entirely mini-games. As anyone who has played FFXIII-2 will tell you, the clock puzzles SUCK. Most of them aren't that difficult and can be brute-forced. But there are a few that all but require a website for calculating solutions. Either take advantage of the tools the internet has made available to you, or watch in horror as the pacing dies a painful death, your choice. The grind isn't quite as bad as FFXIII, but expect to spend a lot of time in the Archylte Steppe fighting the same monsters for potent orbs, essences, & crystals. After completing the game, all of the major DLC is unlocked. In the Coliseum, players will engage in battle with numerous fan-favorites, and a few characters from FFXIII. I find it amusing that one of the opponents should have been in a boss-fight in FFXIII, but it never happened because reasons. I won't spoil it, but if you played FFXIII, then you already know who I'm talking about. You'll want to fight these battles not just because they're quite good, but also because you can recruit everyone you defeat. The next DLC adventure is a solo battle between Lightning and Caius. Lightning has a specific set of roles, and is expected to switch between them constantly. For example, she can use the knight role to become impervious to damage, and it's necessary to avoid getting one-shotted by a handful of Caius's attacks. Since this DLC doesn't require Serah & Noel, you can do it immediately after completing the game to gain a powerful ally. Sazh's DLC adventure takes place in a Casino. He's trapped in limbo, and his son is nowhere to be found, only by gambling can they hope to be re-united. While the concept sounds sufficiently dark, this isn't exactly Gambling Apocalypse Sazh. The goal is to acquire 30 fortune medals, which can be done in less than 30 minutes by playing Texas Hold'em. The casino is also available in the main-game, though all N&S can do is play slots and race their chocobos. Once I got the items I required, I never went back. I'll admit, I enjoyed my time with this game more than FFXIII. Noel, Serah, and Caius are some of the better JRPG heroes and villains I've seen. Trying to make sense of everything is headache-inducing, but the revamped crystarium and monster-raising provided excellent distractions. The combat itself also recieved some slight improvements, like paradigm  shifting being noticeably faster. The various areas/times/dimensions being more than a narrow corridor definitely helped, though the quests tend to be of the fetching variety. The port still could have been a lot better though. I'm not nearly as frustrated about it now as was when I started the PC version, but Square-enix isn't getting a passing grade for this one. FFXIII and its sequel deserve better ports, but I expect Lightning Returns to be at about the same quality as the previous two PC entries; superior to the console versions, and not much else.",Recommended,

Imo this game shouldn't exist but only because of the story. The first game, XIII, wasn't perfect but the story was good. Nothing special, some plotholes but still good. Well XIII-2 makes everything more complicated and even less clear. It's nothing like X-2 which was a good follow up to X (tho I also don't like that because it invalidates a lot of thing from the first game). So I'm really torn here.But the gameplay is really good! I liked the gameplay of XIII but this is even better. The Crystarium is a bit wtf for first time but it's really good once you understand how does it work. And the best part: the monster as your party member system. Literally Pokemon. Ok not but it's really fun and it works as it should. I only wish there were some kind of in-battle interactions with the monsters (like how you talk with Mog throughout the game)So yeah that's a good game but far from perfect.

Kosmozuikis,48.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/,"April 27, 2021",35,"I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy series, maybe not hardcore fan but this is one of my favorite game series. And Final Fantasy XIII-2 in my opinion is one of the worst games in the whole series. But that doesn't mean it's bad. Final Fantasy XIII lacked a lot of things which made the game a FF game. But I really loved combat in that game. While this game retains very similar combat system it simply lacks characters. You can't build a team since it has very limited playable characters. You play as Serah (oh how I wanted to play as her, it's like dream come true, cutie) and Noel. You can have third party member as a captured monster. They also can evolve and you have quite a bit of choice which monster you want to use. Other than that the combat is very similar to FF XIII – it's fast but it allows some tactical gameplay and isn't as boring as turn based combat. Yes I get it turn based combat has a lot more tactical possibilities but most of the time you're fighting regular monsters which are easy to beat and you run into them a lot, so waiting each time while clicking one button becomes boring after your 100th fight.This time Serah and Noel embark on a journey to find Lightning. They travel through time to various locations some being new and some you've visited in previous game. Although those locations are quite different when you travel there because of the time period you travel to.There are a lot of locations to explore. From vast open areas to some weird sci-fi-like mazes and cities. What I loved about the setting was that the game feels pretty dark, the worlds you travel to are desolate and the whole atmosphere is like that. It's still pretty but feels very eerie, grim, dismal (can't find a word for it).So the whole gameplay is exploring those areas in different time periods and fighting enemies alongside doing some side quests. But there's one gameplay mechanic I hated, I hated it to the degree it almost ruined the whole game for me. It's clock puzzles. When you get there you'll know why. Don't believe me? Google it, someone even made clock puzzle solver. I have no idea why they put this crap into a game.Of course there a chocobos and moogles so it has at least a bit of Final Fantasy soul. But nearly everything else which made Final Fantasy great is gone just like in XIII.Graphically it looks surprisingly good considering the age of this game. The game looks really pretty, character models are very high quality (except AI characters) and since the PS3 release the hair modelling still looks great today.Areas are ranging from ok to good in my opinion. Some could use more work and some look really good.Since this is an old game, PS3 port, it should run pretty good but don't expect performance to be great. It's straight up PS3 port after all. Porting from PS3 was difficult, besides seeing the game's price it's clear SE did not put a lot of effort into porting this.Sound design is great as always in the series. Music is very good and in some areas it creates that kind of hopeless, the end of the world mood. Voice acting is good too, I have no complaints.It's a decent Final Fantasy game. If you enjoyed XII you will enjoy this too. But somehow it feels even smaller than XIII, lacks characters and the whole time traveling is a bit tiring and confusing. But it retained the combat system which makes fighting fun. Get this on sale if you enjoy FF or jrpg's in general.",Recommended,

brianbcdefg123,79.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bcdefg123/,"December 29, 2015",6,"As a spinoff, it's not everyone's Final Fantasy. But it does attempt to rectify some of the problems that XIII had.First, the story, which is a weakness. I do not believe XIII-2 or Lightning Returns should have been attached to XIII. Each of them convolute the story so much, adding and changing the mythos in unnecessary ways. Personal beef aside, XIII-2 takes place... uh, anytime and everytime after XIII. That's right, you'll be traveling through time. It continues after XIII and retcons the happy ending. Series heroine Lightning has disappeared, and as her younger sister Serah, the only one who seems to remember her, you need to team up with Noel, the last survivor of humanity in the far-off future, to find the source of a timeline disturbance and fix it.The combat is similar to XIII, which is a more dynamic version of the ATB system from many other FF games. The difference here is that you always play as the same two characters, plus your choice of captured monster. In this game, you can recruit enemy monsters, each with a specific combat role (medic, physical attacker, magic attacker, etc.), as opposed to Serah and Noel who can change roles. You can change combat roles for your party on the fly during battle to react to the situation.Exploration is limited, each area is self-contained and you travel between each area/time via a menu. Some locations are used more than once, and you can explore them in different times to reach new areas and quests. Also unlike FFXIII, you can get sidequests from the beginning of the game. Completings quests will get you fragments, the chief indicator of progress. There are 160 fragments to collect. On the surface, I like the concept of fragments, reminiscent of Sonic Adventure's emblems. Most are single challenges. You'll have about half of them or maybe less if you're just gunning for the end (if memory serves). There is a meaty postgame, but it does get slow and annoying at times (but not as slow as FFXIII) and the fragment that has you logging battles with every single monster will be annoying, but perfectly passable with a guide. The Paradox Ending concept is also annoying too. Oh, and the quizzes in Academia. You would probably not know how to get all of them without a guide. Also unlike FFXIII, levels are not just single tunnels, but Academia (all time periods, really) is an unneccessary overcompensation. It's huge and confusing.Ah, almost forgot! The port. Both XIII and Lightning Returns are better that XIII-2. Nearly everyone has encountered slowdown with this game. It is simply not optimized well. That said, it never became unplayable for me, and I mean ACTUALLY unplayable instead of 'OMG it's 59 FPS instead of 60 FPS' like some people who use that term. This does dip below 30 FPS at points where I could run XIII at a pretty smooth 60 throughout. I can deal with that, but some people can't. It does not excuse Square Enix from doing that to us. The game's $20, though, so yeah.In summary, the game is worth the price. You'll have to deal with lag and a story that simply didn't need to happen, but you have a fun battle system and more exploration than FFXIII in return.",Recommended,

Its much better than XIII so check it out. Overall its gotten better but isn't the best, I can't give them a thumbs down for this one for trying however I hope they really look into the performance problems that fluctuates the boards for players.Be wary of this purchase because I am hearing that many people with high end pc having hitches.

Blackgun,46.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088084847/,"May 13, 2020",6,"Pretty good overall experience. If you didnt enjoy ff13's gameplay then i cant blame you. There havent been many changes to the basic mechanics (you still mainly just spam auto battle and let the game decide for you outside of specific cases), but the major overhaul of the party building (you recruit monsters you kill, allowing you to customize your party with thousands of combinations), and many QoL improvements (you dont lose when party leader dies, faster paradigm shifts etc.) make the game worth giving a shot. Story is actually comprehensible without reading tons of pages of encyclopedia (you still need to know what happened in 13 to grasp the story though), characters are better and fleshed out, tons of side quests (way over half the gameplay time is optional side quests), lot of exploration, good music and decent graphics. Be warned though, this is an atrocious PC port, you need to use fanmade patches to make the game run decently, and even then you will probably not achieve a stable framerate. Neverthless, its a good game worth getting on sale. I'd recommend",Recommended,

Content based comments. I'll not refer to the technical side of the game, since I'm not gamer enough to comment on it.If you consider buying this game, get them all. All 3 of them. FINAL FANTASY® XIII, FINAL FANTASY® XIII-2 and LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII. And play through them all in this order before you judge the storyline. This set of games has a complicated storyline with lots of details and temporary endings that won't be resolved until the very end. THat's what I really like about this series. I've heard a lot of people saying the main character Lightning is cold. Not only can I not agree with it, it's also resolved at the very end. Final Fantasy - as far as I could grasp the concept so far (I'm no expert) with it's games, movies and series - deals with the topics of things coming to some end in some sense (as in ""Final"") and the dreams, hopes, illusions people have (as in ""Fantasy""). What hope is left and born when you reach the end? So naturally there's a lot of complexity involved. A lot of ""reading between the lines"" is required. And the very best of it: as much as there's ""good"" and ""evil"", in the Final Fantasy stories there's like a TON of ""in-between"". The developers show the light and shades within everyone and everything. So, if you are not scared and interested into diving into the complexity of mankind, this game is for you.If you want to learn and see what potentials ""drama"", ""bad luck"" and ""tragedy"" can bring forth, this game is for you.If you like beautiful scenery, music and character design, this game is for you.If you like a bit of fighting (which can be adjusted in difficulty and frequency by personal taste) but mainly enjoy stories, this game is for you.This game is probably NOT for you if you ar hardcore gamer loving overly difficult gameplay, grinding and so on. You can dive into the complexity of the game and find out about all of te effect and how to use them best and you can go out for hunting for hours BUT you don't need to.

Merle,57.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/merlesythia/,"September 3, 2019",6,"Just got finished replaying FFXIII and FFXIII-2 back to back so figured I'd write a review.This is the best game in the trilogy due to the gameplay. Replaying FFXIII felt tedious, though the story and music are the best in the trilogy. Battles took forever and the entire game was basically one long corridor. I enjoy FFXIII overall but I still acknowledge the flawsFFXIII-2 has much more addictive gameplay. The battle system feels more refined than FFXIII and you can swap paradigms more quickly. Catching and taming monsters makes battles more rewarding. You can build an ultimate monster by fusing other monsters into your monster.Multiple endings give the game a Chrono Trigger vibe (not saying this is anywhere near as good as CT). It's neat to find out how actions you take at one part of the timeline can affect the future of the timeline.This game does have flaws. The music ranges from passable to appalling (Crazy Chocobo is a song that never should have existed). The plot feels like a fan fic, but it's not a horrible fan-fic. There are some cool parts in the story, but the quality isn't as good overall as FFXIII.If you enjoyed FFXIII and you like catching final fantasy monsters, you'll probably like this game. I also recommend World of Final Fantasy.I should also note that I did experience crashing when I first started playing the game. This fixed it:",Recommended,
UltimaCJ,57.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimacj/,"April 20, 2015",25,"All my friends told me that FF13-2 a  was a fantastic game vs its predassor.  Mind you, like last time, I do not own a PS3 so this is my first time expereincing this game.  I will say this game was ten times better than its original.  Not as long in terms of linear play (although the game is still linear but not as linear).  Unlike the last game,you'll play as Lightnings HOT sister Serah and a new person into the mix:  Noel who comes from a ruined future.The basic theme of this game is time travelling.  I don't care much for time travel themes because they generally get confusing of where to go next (Majora's Mask / Epherial Phantasia), but the time travelling here is not confusing and it's very straight forward for the most part.  As for storyline elements keyed into the game, one might argue or have issues with it (because of time travelling and all the paradoxes that can happen but that's another disucssion).This is the first FF I think I've played were the only party members are Serah and Noel.  However, your third party member is that you tame and capture monsters.  So they took a page from the  Dragon Warrior series (nice!).  Overall done well in terms of leveling up, but it would have been nice w/o looking at a guide to guess what materials did what or looking at a shop.  Just show me the requirement like most games do, would have been nice.  Leveling up is similar but more simpfiled which is nice, although it would be nice to look far ahead like in the last 13 game to see what I'm about to learn so I can level accordingly.The combat system is back like last time, a bit more polished up but it's still a button masher here and there.  Which overall doesn't bother me.  Still as fast pace as ever with paragrham shifts.Overall....Pros:  *Fantastic story!  It kept me captivated til the very end and kept me asking questions.*Fun QTE's and interactive novel like storyline presentation (novel part was a bit repeative but nothing bad).*Fantastic music, better than the last game.*More mini games and challenges and extra content upon finishing.*Unlike the last time, there are graphical settings.  Though people still complained about stablitiy, the only issue I had if there was no 360 controller plugged in, the game would stutter.  Why this happens is beyond me but should be something to be looked into especailly for those who don't have a controller.*Loved the ""previously on 13-2"" while the game loaded, very TV show like!*NO DOOM (thank GOD)Cons:*Stuttering w/o a gamepad plugged in (again may only happen on certain systems but still a con)*Felt wierd having only two key storyline characters.*Like last time, character movement would just 'stop' which became annoying for areas you needed to jump in.*Certain araes had a high encounter rate*Sometimes collecting fragments/wild artifacts to progress the game was a pain.*Finishing the game because I enjoyed it so much was sad to let it go.  Yeah story was that goodWhile I've heard 13-3 is crap, I still plan to play it because how the story was in 13-2.Overall I recommend this game, though you may want to play 13 just to see how crappy it was, but 13-2 certainly makes up for it.No DOOM was casted while writing this review.",Recommended,

After playing through it I have to agree this game have serious flaws and I will discuss in the spoiler section down below. Graphic of this game is still pretty awesome for a game 6 years old. Music and sound effect are very nicely done. One of the riding chocobo theme Song and back ground BGM of 700-AF-""A Dyeing World"" is particularly beautiful and masterfully done. Since it's a port of Final Fantasy and we all know Square does very bad support when its games are ported to PC. There will always be a lot problem to fix all the crush and graphics bug etc. Lucky for us there is a full guide on steam community that fix every issue for me and I was able to get game running smoothly after about half an hour of fixing. The Story is what I call a branched tree with a linear root. You are free to explore what you want on the story tree branch of each different time period but eventually you have gone to the story main root without deviations. In fact, you kind of have to explore nearly every tree branches eventually anyways to proceed smoothly.Cut-scene and combat design are very nicely done. Some of the fight scene and live action trigger are very nicely designed and wonderful eye candy.Control and combat are very simple to use but needs a bit customization to work actually effectively. I do believe there are a lot player finished the game without knowing how to switch between single target spell focus and AOE Spell focus. Monster taming is actually pretty fun and if after finishing the game and go to coliseum you can fight a whole bunch of fun character such as snow, lighting, and even omega weapon from FF6. They are also all Tamable! I caught a Lighting myself and it’s actually really fun to have her on the team and make it also feel like a 3 Player game instead of 2 player team. You can also dress up your monster with the ornaments you get in the game and transfer passive skill from other monster to your favorite ones. Too bad Potent items are rare drops in the game and you can only buy them after your finish the main game. Ok. That’s it. I will give this a game 6/10 and a thumb up barely. I guess I still enjoyed the game enough to recommend it barely and it just hurts to see a finally fantasy game scored so low so I will bump it up a little. Why I rated it so low? Well, Read the following spoiler sections.Spoiler Below:Well.. Problem of this game is logic. Storyline logic and design choice logic.First is the Storyline is super messy and logic is weird!FFXIII finish with a miracle by goddess Etro. She personally saved your entire team from the crystal fate except 2 of them. Doing so she got weak and released the chaos and destroyed the world. She was able to use last of her strength to reseal chaos and go into a slowly dying crystal sleep herself. Doing so she was able to restore most of the timeline except main hero Lighting fall to Valhalla to became a guardian of the sleeping goddess and thus create a Time Paradox the ripple through the ages. That Paradox cause effect up and down the history and watcher of history Yeul was killed because she now sees a different version of history. Which caused a future guardian of Yeul angry at the goddess and came to Valhalla to confront the goddess and lighting. In this battle between Lighting and Guardian Caius the last human at end of human history which is also the last guardian Noel fall through time gate into Valhalla. Realize an end of world situation is unavoidable Lighting sent Noel to find her sister and bring her to Valhalla. Her sister Serah was a far seer that’s not Yeul team up with Noel which is the only one that can kill Caius team up to fix history while changing history to try to get to Valhalla to meet up lighting. This caused many Yeul in many histories saw different version of history and dying over and over. Which caused Caius to go crazy to change more history and go to Valhalla. After sending Noel and Serah on their mission to Fix/Break History Lighting conceded in battle again Caius and froze herself in crystal and waiting for the hero team to break the history and caused the end of world. End of the world then happen when your main character team’s triumph and then your main playable character Serah dies and End of world happens.After the end of the world then she will be the only one spared and go on Journey herself to fix everything herself and that’s story of “lighting return.”Yes. Huge wall of text with character story and timeline mixed together with complicated relationship between multiple people.Simple put. A goddess made a mistake that screwed up everything. Lighting end up choose to trick he sister to try to save the world but instead of breaking history line. That caused end of the world which Lighting herself world be spared and wake up in her crystal sleep later to fix the world herself in third game of the Series. I am speechless for this weird story-line.2. Design choice logic of the game.Whose idea is it to create complicated math clock puzzle that you have to solve repeated in the game? And its time limited for 1 minute for god sake. I am pretty good at math and I can solve this by writing it down and test it but in 1 minute solve a puzzle with 13 clock location is nearly humanly impossible. You will probably have to pause the game write down the number do the home work then solve the puzzle. Whose idea to put keys of wild artifact in weird location?You have to find those little things to proceed and at least 4/10 are not easily found with no hint given on where they are. This is a open world game that have a lot ground to cover!! One of them need to you answer a certain way doing a live trigger event, If you miss you have to find gate seal to seal it then redo the story again and it’s super long.Whose idea to do the final maze in 3D plat-former setting?This is not a platform game and why this last map have to be like this? And platform game you don’t have to deal with all those RPG random fight to slow down the learning process!Got very angry when I try to finish writing this review.

This is not the case, in fact Square Enix has taken one step forward but two steps back in the performance department with this PC port.First of all, my computer exceeds the recommended specs in every aspect, therefore hardware should not be an issue.  This being said, frame rates are NOT stable and fluctuate between 25 and 60 fps, despite Square Enix promising ""60 fps gaming.""  Rain is rendered poorly in this game and appears white and pixelated.   The good news is that graphics settings are now adjustable in the game launcher.  The available settings are Screen Settings, Resolution, Sound Settings, Shadow resolution, and Anti-aliasing.  The bad news is that lowering these settings does absolutely nothing to alleviate performance issues.  I've tried adjusting settings via the game launcher and my graphics card driver, to no avail.   No matter how low I set my graphics settings, my frame rate is unstable or is locked at 30 fps in many areas.Overall Final Fantasy 13-2, while a solid console game, is still not up to par as a PC port.  I thought Square Enix would have their act together by now since they have had experience porting several other Final Fantasy titles to PC.  The shoddy performance is just too hard to ignore, especially since Square Enix promised ""60 fps gaming"" but actually 30 fps is a lot closer to reality.  Square Enix should have taken more time to port this game and check for performance issues; I would rather have played a polished game at a later date than a shoddy one at an earlier date.  Until Square Enix fixes these glaring performances problems, I cannot recommend this game.*Update* So I have looked into the ""missing"" DLC issue and apparently the DLCs are included in the game, but for some reason they do not unlock until the game is beaten, which was not the case with the console version.

However, when I played it I was at a constant 60 FPS and it didn't crash once. The ONLY issue I had with it was the rain, which for some reason got very milky white and intense in this version. There is a mod to fix it though, so it definitley wasn't game-breaking. Maybe those people were trying to play the game on a crappy computer? I'm unsure, but on my end, I didn't have any problems and it played flawlessly.On a less technical note, this game is actually my favorite in the series. This is my second time playing it, having platted it once on the PS3, and I definitly wouldn't have bothered doing that (or playing it AGAIN, mind you) if it wasn't enjoyable. Yes, it's plot makes it obvious that they never planned for this sequel, but at least it ties in nicely with Lightning Returns. It's no longer linear (unlike it's predecessor pre-endgame), and the battle system brings everything good from the first game and allows you more customization in your battle teams with the addition of monsters (who can be infused with others for your own unique set up) as your third party member. I do miss having Lightning and the normal 'gang' around, but the addition of Caius, Yeul, and Noel, who are great characters in their own right, does make up for it. I think the only complaint I have about this game is the music - some of it, like the metal-esque sounding stuff - is a bit too much for me at times.Just give it a shot though.

I was slightly disappointed to see that Serah was really the only character from the previous game that you got to interact with on a regular basis. I got over that pretty quickly, however. The story for this game is fantastic, on par with the previous game.. if not maybe just a bit better. The combat system is the same as the previous game, so if you liked it in FFXIII this game is just a rehash of that system. There is a difference in party makeup though. Instead of a 3-character party makeup you have the same two characters the entire game (Serah and Noel) but have the ability to capture, train, level, and use field monsters as your third party member. At first this seemed lame, but shortly after there became a collector aspect of it that i really enjoyed. Having a party of nothing but multicolored chocobos was really fun. You may also see complaints about the game not running well; as long as you arent expecting 60 FPS on max settings while trying to play this on a laptop you borrowed from work.. you'll be fine. The game ran at 59.97 FPS @1080p and all settings to their maximum (and also extended settings via the Nvidia cpl) consistently on my gaming machine, which is a couple of years old at this point.

Burning Finger,45.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sofrencia/,"July 30, 2021",10,"My favorite final fantasies are VI, IX, and XII, and I hated FFXIII. If you have similar tastes you might find this review useful.I hated the first FFXIII, it was awful, I wrote a review for it explaining why I have this opinion.This game is much better, it fixes a lot of the problems the first game had. The structure is much better, there's actual exploration now instead of just straight halways, and more side content besides just killing monsters after long, tedious walks.Combat and customization is also better. The two main characters are pretty static with what you can do with them but the third party member (a monster) is up to you and you can do a lot with it. Combat is also faster, in the original game sometimes I didn't even want to paradigm shift because the animation was so long. Animations are faster and this game doesn't have trash mobs with huge HP pools like the first game. This is a huge quality of life improvement.They also got rid of the awful weapon/accesory upgrade system. You just get weapons or accessories and that's it. The complicated and opaque upgrade system from the previous game did not make it more complex or interesting, just more annoying.These were my main gripes with the original game, the fixes this game brings make it a much more enjoyable experience.If you played FFXIII, saw a decent game there screwed by poor design decisions, and wish it were better, then this is the game you want. Hell, you don't even need to play the first game, this one comes with explanations of what happened in the first game if you want to watch/read about it.",Recommended,
frog,62.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Froggedwolf/,"July 13, 2020",10,"Before everything, I'd like to say I won't consider the quality of the port in my rating but only how good the game is. Talking about the port it is bad, garbage even, and it is a shame that a company as big as Square Enix allow such port, and show that they do not care much about their PC players since they never bothered to fix any of those problems.Most problems can be solved by a fan patch and steam cloud turned off as the game crash if the cloud is on.Now that we're done talking about how crap the port is I can tell my opinion on the game itself.8/10.I have to say I wasn't expecting much playing this game after playing the first one that I heavily disliked but to my surprise this game was actually better in many ways, it fix most of the problems of the first game even the famous linearity problem that was never a problem to begin with imo.You do not necessarily need to play the first game in order to understand the second one, there is a menu called beginner's guide that sum up the entirity of the first game, BUT I think you'll enjoy more the second one if you play the first one first, for obvious reasons, a lot of the characters in the second game are returning characters from the first one you'll be more emotionally invested in the game if you play the first one before, even if you don't like those characters, the two protagonists are new tho (half new in Serah's case).The story that was one of my biggest complain about the first game and is now quite good actually, it was enjoyable, maybe a bit too much sometimes, but really, I liked the journey it was definitely interesting, also there is finally a memorable villain character in the game, and I enjoyed it, the two mains characters aren't awful either, Serah isn't the most interesting but I found Noel quite good and the mystery around him is definitely a big part of why the game is good.The gameplay is very similar to the first game, they fixed the gameover if your main character die which help a lot to not be frustrated, the game is easier aswell which might not be the best for everyone, and they added a monster taming part in the game that while not awful didn't really interest me that much, the monster variety in the game isn't it's strong point and the monster design is lacking, it is necessary to have good monsters to progress as they often have things that Serah and Noel tend to lack, it isn't necessary to grind much to have good enough monsters tho, truth be told I only had to get better one before the last chapter.The soundtracks has some nice tracks and some awful one, the crazy chocobo song for example I do not know who thought it was a nice idea, but it definitely wasn't, some other tracks are nice and I'd say I prefer the soundtrack of the second game compared to the first.The level design is million times better as well, the levels are less greyish and much more enjoyable, I had a huge problems with the maps of the first game, I enjoyed a lot those of this one except one of the last map that you'll have the pleasure to see if you play the game.There is more post game content than the first game but it's shorter, less running around, less need to be grinding to be able to defeat monsters and again a way less difficult game, you need less strategy to do the bosses which is probably a worse thing, it doesn't push the fighting system as much as the first game does but I'd say overall it's better again you have different task to do, many ways to do, you collect fragment to complete the game, you xp with each of them, you have mini games and a casino, there are cities and it feels like there is life unlike the first game again where you only fight from the beginning to the end and there is no soul to be seen.The DLC aren't good, don't expect anything great out of them, maybe the colisseum actually have it's use since it can add a challenge later on in the game with strong memorable bosses and long fights, you can eventually collect some powerful monsters with it too, but since you're done with the game after it whats the point ? The two others dlc aren't worth much, the Lightning story was a pain in the ass for me to do, it was really uninteresting but I did it for the story sake, it felt like a chore, and you have to die and retry to be able to succeed in it, or maybe if you're good enough you can find a challenge in it, but thats pushing it heavily.Sazh's dlc is about minigames and isn't very interesting either, I guess it's nice for a change of pace sometimes but you unlock it after the ending of the game, and the story is very barebone in it, I wouldn't call it a nice dlc, not at all.Overall I'd say 2/10 for the DLC and thats only cause the colisseum is pushing them up.",Recommended,

SishirC,22.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sishirc/,"July 20, 2022",7,"So I feel this is an unnecessary sequel because FF XIII ended perfectly with no lose ends. But I give it a positive review because even though it is unneeded, the story is actually quite good. And they've changed up the gameplay enough to make it go from unbearably boring to tolerable. The stupid interrupting animations when you switch paradigms are gone and the problem of enemies having 420 bazillion HP is not as bad as in XIII. And since this is a much shorter game, you level up much faster, eliminating most of the grinding required. The biggest improvement though is the levels. They are now much more open instead of the single hallways of XIII and feel great to explore.The story, as I've said, is pretty good. Though I would've liked it more if the cast of the previous game had more screentime. Especially Snow since the whole game of XIII was about him saving Serah and now he almost isn't in this game. Also the ending was very very unexpected.Oh and the PC port is just as terrible as the previous game. No quit button, barebones settings, horrendous volume mixing where you can't hear the dialogue properly, and performance issues. But I guess that is to be expected of Square Enix at this point. Get all the necessary mods and it'll make your experience slightly better.If you feel like playing more FF XIII, then this is more of it but improved. And if you feel like XIII is a complete story, you can skip this entirely as well with no issues.",Recommended,
DRUNK_CANADIAN,4.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DRUNK_CANADIAN/,"December 11, 2014",27,"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a decent/good JRPG, but a subpar Final Fantasy game.  It continues to tow the line of deviation from what made the core series so great, interesting backstories and adventuring prospects and an overall cohesive main story.  Despite this it is still a better game than FFXIII, and its two main characters actually have significant character development (relative to FFXIII at least). This game although graphically stunning is lacking substance, and albeit improving on some of the linearity of FFXIII it is still not of the same caliber of  other Final Fantasy games and is a forgettable experience. That being said with the exception of some of the developments in FFXIII- Lightning returns aka. 3, much of this game can retroactively be ignored (FFXIII-Lightning returns is arguably the strongest installment in the trilogy, both gameplay and story wise). The story in this game is disjointed so much that playing Metal Gear Solid 4 before any of the others will logically make more sense than some of the components of this game.Gameplay wise, its minimalist approach isn't all bad. You have two main playable characters, Serah and Noel and an captured monster that assists as a third member. The combat as a result offers more complexity than FFXIII-2 albeit still is rudimentary. The exploration involves a variety of areas, not bound by the linear connections that FFXIII's were, and as such you get more opportunities to adventure. You will have an enjoyable experience facing off against the classic assortment of FF foes and a few unique new ones. It should be noted, as stated prior that much of the cast of the previous game is not playable, and Lightning, whom I'd consider as the saving grace in FFXIII has behind the scenes role in this game, despite much of the plot relating to her. Overall the gameplay is worth picking this game up for alone, if you can tolerate the subpar storytelling and disjointed story.I can't recommend this as a Final Fantasy game, but I can recommend it as a JRPG, at its core its still an enjoyable experience that you will find investing many hours in as you continue your adventure in the FFXIII universe.",Recommended,

Sadly. the story makes little sense and was just written to set up a third game. Despite that, the villain is much better than XIII and makes a lot more sense.

It's a good game, a decent JRPG on steam, but I';m not srure if peoplePeople are asking.... I bet this twice (80+ hours on PS3). My advice tho?

Ezah,88.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ezah11/,"September 15, 2020",6,"*Note: Turn off steam cloud auto saves before playing, there is a bug that causes the game to crash if it is on. It occurred for me about 7 hours in*This steam port is well known for being a technical mess, but outside of serious frame drops within the first hour and the cloud save crash bug, I had no problems. Everything ran fine, with a few dropped frames here and there, but still perfectly enjoyable.As for the the game itself, it improves upon most of its predecessor's deficiencies. There is plenty of choice in where to take your adventure. Gone is the 20 hour long corridor to start the game, and instead we get to jump around several small hub sized worlds. There are plenty of places to go, and each of them requires a few return trips to complete everything. Unfortunately many of those places are just the same location at a different time, which makes finding everything a bit of a nightmare as you might have a clue as to where to check for something, but when you have to check the same spot in 4 different eras, it becomes a wild goose chase. Combat got some tweaks too, most notably the initial paradigm shift no longer has a long animation that stalls out combat for an extended period of time, which is a very nice quality of life update. Otherwise, you now only have 2 party members in the protagonists Noel and Serah, along with an interchangeable monster in the 3rd party slot that you can pick up Pokemon style. It still felt good like 13 did, but with less varied nuance as Noel and Serah have defined skill sets, with the best support abilities being sequestered onto rare or late game monsters, so your strategies are somewhat limited, although the game tends to be somewhat easy so not being able to rotate through 6 characters of varying specialties from the first game isn't as much of a hindrance.In general I would say this game is good for you if you liked the gameplay of the first, but wanted something more open. This one is my favorite of the 13 trilogy, but I'm a sucker for collect-a-thons and it's quite easy to adapt to the combat style of this game after playing the original.",Recommended,
NN010,33.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NN010/,"August 25, 2022",5,"Short Version: It's better than XIII! With a somehow more straightforward story and an emotional core about the value of life & determining your own destiny XIII-2's highs are much higher than XIII's. Combine that with the game giving you access to XIII's combat system's full potential from the get-go & great as always music, XIII-2 is worth playing if you managed to get through XIII. Hell, skipping XIII & jumping straight to XIII-2 wouldn't be the worst idea given the story does sideline most of the first game's main cast & focuses on new characters (and Serah, but she was a crystal for most of XIII anyway).Now I'll have to see if Lightning Returns keeps up this momentum! Especially given that cliffhanger.Long Version:In many ways, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a product of its circumstances. It (as well as its sequel Lightning Returns (review coming soon)) is a game that mainly exists due to the calamitous launch of Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 doing a lot of damage to the company & the need to recoup the money lost on that disaster somehow, and with Final Fantasy Versus XIII still deep in development hell (and still a couple of years away from being turned into Final Fantasy XV) and XIV being in no position to do so on its own without an expensive ground-up rebuilding of the game, Square ended up deciding that cashing in on the commercial success of Final Fantasy XIII & making a sequel or two to it that heavily reused technology & assets from XIII was the best option.It is also a product of its circumstances due to its design choices, which were a mix of walking back things people hated about XIII, working within a more limited budget due to Square Enix’s financial troubles at the time (due to the aforementioned failure of FFXIV 1.0 & a then-recent acquisition of Eidos and their studios (ex: Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal) & following design trends of the late 2000s-early 2010s era of gaming. For instance, the linear structure of XIII is replaced with a much more open-ended one where you can play most missions during the middle portion of the game in any order you please (although the cutscenes do feel written with a particular order in mind).There are also much fewer pre-rendered cinematics than XIII, down to 2 that book-end the story plus a couple of extensions of XIII’s ending cinematic. Whether this decrease is down to budgetary restrictions, the short for an RPG 18-month development cycle leaving little time for more cinematics, a desire to cram the entire game onto a single Xbox 360 DVD (the first game was made with the PS3’s Blu-Ray discs in mind & the 360 port had to be split across 3 DVDs as a result of all the pre-rendered cinematics, and even then they were of a lower resolution, bitrate & different video format than the PS3’s cutscenes (the PS3 & Xbox One backcompat versions have 1080p cutscenes encoded in a proprietary Sony-developed format (reencoded in Bink Video for the Xbox One) while the Xbox 360 & PC have 720p cutscenes in the Bink Video format that are highly compressed)) or a combination of the above is unclear, but the end result is the same.The visuals, while pretty good for 2011, are also mostly just coasting off of reused assets from XIII (presumably another result of the circumstances of this game’s creation), although what new assets are present are some of the best-looking things in the entire game and do hold up against other games of that year like Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception.The combat is a strange topic for me with regards to this game. On one hand, not much has changed compared to XIII, with the biggest changes being the ability to change party leaders mid-fight & the addition of a Pokemon/Persona-esque monster-catching mechanic (almost certainly to make up for the lack of a character to fill that third slot due to Noel & Serah being the only two protagonists). But on the other hand, I also enjoyed XIII-2’s combat a lot more than XIII’s (I actually rage-quit XIII almost halfway through because of the combat to be honest). I can’t quite put my finger on why, but I think it’s related to how XIII-2 gives you access to the full potential of its combat system early, whereas XIII consistently leaves you with only two party members until past the halfway point of the game (by which point many players, myself included, will have quit). That or the drastically reduced difficulty. Could also be that.As for the story, it’s a significant improvement over XIII. The presence of a clear antagonist throughout the story (whereas XIII didn’t really have one until well into the 2nd act) who has a clear goal helps give the story clearer stakes & a persistent emotional throughline. Said emotional throughline is focused around 3 of this game’s new characters: Noel Kriess (one of the protagonists along with Serah), Caius Ballad (the main antagonist) & Yeul (a young girl who can see the future & changes to the timeline at the cost of a drastically shortened lifespan & eternal reincarnation and Caius’s charge) and made me to tear up numerous times. It’s not perfect, though. This game’s time travel rules are very convoluted (for example, the game makes a big deal about how changing the future changes the past, but they also allow players to revisit timelines that should have been overwritten by such changes. For example, there are two versions of Academia circa 400 AF (AF being short for After the Fall of Cocoon) you can visit in the game & both of them are accessible whenever you please once you’ve unlocked them, presumably for gameplay reasons due to this game’s non-linear structure. Overall I liked it though.One thing I should note is that the PC port of this game is a mess. It’s unstable, has performance issues no matter what hardware you run & is prone to crashing. Fortunately, though, there are mods out there that fix these issues. This Steam guide should help you get this game to a more stable state on PC. If you’d rather not deal with mods, I’d suggest playing the Xbox 360 version on an Xbox One, One X, Xbox Series X or Series S instead for a better out-of-the-box experience.Conclusion:Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a step forward from the first game, but is very much an iterative sequel. At least the story is surprisingly good for a game slapped together in less than 2 years to keep a company afloat…Ratings:Creative score (story, gameplay, voice acting, art direction): 7.5/10Technical score (graphics, audio, performance)): 6/10 (pretty good graphics for its day, but the PC port is terrible)Business Practices score: 6.5/10 (not terrible, but there was a lot of DLC for this game, including some bizarre Assassin’s Creed & Mass Effect crossover costumes)Overall score (my thoughts on a game’s overall quality, doesn’t consider the business practices unless they are detrimental to the experience): 7/10",Recommended,

I bought it last in 2016 and ran into several issues. The most annoying issue was also see non stop in the Steam port of Final Fantasy XIII. The keyboard would sporadically become unrecognized by the game and require unplugging and reconnecting it via USB to the computer. This issue is known in the community and still persists in both games. An issue I have in this game besides the keyboard is unknown instant crashing of the game without errors noted; Seeminly at random. Since you can't save when you want and the autosave feature is only at certain points, I have lost entire maps worth of work. This crashing is also known if you research online in the community.Game would be great if both those were addressed but it has been a few years and it is not likely going to be. I put tons of time into FFXIII with the keybaord problem, but very little into this do to the crashes.Hope this helps before you purchase any of the FFXIII games.

The narrative relies heavily on ""paradoxes"" (which acts very similarly to nanomachines from the MGS series) to justify major shifts in tone, which can be irritating after a certain point.

Pandemonium,27.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Into_Chaos/,"January 18, 2015",14,"Given the mixed reception the Final Fantasy 13 series seems to be getting about its ports, I thought I'd throw my opinion in on this aswell.As a game, Final Fantasy 13-2 is somewhat of an improvement on its predecessor in terms of gameplay and in my own opinion fun. It gives you a lot more freedom in terms of what you want to do during the course of the game and although you will eventually have to follow the main story to progress to later stages of the game, you could easily go ahead and just burn another 3 or 4 hours here and there just exploring and gaining more CP for your characters, materials for your monsters and finding those pesky Artefacts.On the topic of levelling, yes it is a little annoying because the game doesn't fully go over the system and if you are not careful you can indeed make your character weaker because of it. Although it does pretty much imply the way they should be setup with Noel being Strength and Serah being Magic, it doesn't explicitly state it nor does it tell you that you can easily waste CP and Role levels on nodes that give little to no actual benefit which is a slight issue but not one that should make anybody overlook the game, it's trial and error.The third party member in the team will consist of a Monster character, which you find various items to level up unlike the usual CP used for the main PCs. The ability to gain, level and infuse said monsters to make a third player who could be a huge asset to any party you make is a huge plus to it. With that, you can take up to 3 Monsters into a battle as part of a Paradigm Pack, which lets you add them to your current Paradigm setups then change the roles freely to (hopefully) change the tide of battle upon change. Also Paradigm Shifting is a bit quicker, which I personally found a little bonus.The story itself could be confusing, especially if you haven't played the original and it can also get a bit crazy to follow too if you do things in an odd order or seek out Artefacts all the time. It's solid, but it isn't the best and possibly one of the very few things I can pick on within the game.Overall it is a solid game, not amazing by Final fantasy standards but it is worth a go if you played Final Fantasy 13 or really any version of the Final Fantasy series in the past, or if you are like me and just love playing RPGs.",Recommended,

Overall, I do recommend buying this game ""IF"" you bought and loved playing FF13, for the story and graphics if nothing else.  HOWEVER --- and this is where I go off on a complete rant about this game.  This sequel takes a complete turn to how you will play the game, and in my opinion, takes you far far away from the original.  ***BUYER BEWARE, you may spend as much time online researching this game than you do actually playing it.  Because, it is not very intuitive and does lack significantly the continuity of this game overall.  It's hard to follow; ALL of the various paths you are suppose to follow, when and where to find the fragments/ items you need to continue moving forward, once you figure out where you are suppose to go, so very much more.  You are left saying much of the time ""exactly WHAT is my objective now?!""  You cannot and will not finish this game without having external help [period].  Don't let anyone tell you differently, because they are lying and/ or braggarts, and you will get plenty of these examples in the brag-thoughs on Youtube and other various places like I have.  I mean, I do not mind doing ""some"" research online about the games I am playing.  But, I do not like having to keep pausing my game just to finding out that once again I cannot do what I must do, for that road too is yet another dead end.  there are the endless puzzles/ rifts to solve that will rack your brain, and/ or the minimal amount of keys to unlock gates (wild fragments) to continue further, and/ or they are completely hidden like an easter egg hunt, constantly.  This game is complete chaos as far as trying to figure out what/ where to do/ go next!!!... But, YEAH!, people that hated FF13 seem to just love FF13-2, and visa versa, people that love FF13 seem to hate this game.  At least this is my concensus?!... Oh, and the pro's to this game; excellent character development, storyline, graphics, diverse gameplay, multi-purpose gaming (separate gaming abilities; stragegy, action, adventure, etc.), and I've been told it has great replaying qualities to continue your character developement and alternative realities.

Kargor,106.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kargor/,"December 12, 2021",3,"Well, in terms of story, this game is MUCH better than XIII. In fact, this time around, I actually 100% it. While I wasn't happy about the ending, it does just say ""to be continued"" -- so I'm hoping they will resolve it.Of course, it helped that it wasn't as painful to level things as it felt in XIII. The level system sucks because you basically have to use a guide, but it seems it was much faster to get everything to 99. In the cleanup after the ending, I encountered some painfully difficult enemies, and one that I couldn't beat at all -- but I followed another guide to create a very powerful ""COM"" monster that actually made it a breeze (it did require taming a Tonberry, and other endgame stuff, so it's not like I could have done it much earlier. I could have used it for the postgame cleanups, though...).This also shows one of the main gameplay problems the game has: hidden features. A lot of stuff just isn't shown or explained in game, and things like building up monster allies is time consuming and grindy, so expecting people to do it blindly and arrive at something good isn't going to work.Also, due to the way the story is built, quests can be even more confusing because they still don't give any actually useful information as to where to find the objective. And quests themselves are often hidden until some precondition is fulfilled, so you'd have to constantly walk through all the areas and talk to everyone with a speech bubble to see if they happen to have a quest, and even though they didn't have one the last 25 times you talked to them, they might have one now...Add hidden items that are, while not actually invisible, often difficult to spot and can be outside of the reachable area, and you got yourself a game where using a guide is almost a necessity. Heck, a while after I finished the game for the first time and was on my postgame cleanup for 100%, I followed a guide to get one of the hidden endings, and found I actually missed a hidden item that was important for that. And just finding a description on the net didn't help; I actually had to find it on Youtube to see where the item actually was...Still, when I say ""guide"", I don't necessarily mean a walkthrough that you just follow. Myself, I was using a list of the fragments and how to get them, along with some looking up specific things when I ran into a problem. I definitely don't want to follow a step-by-step description that walks me through the game.Oh, and let's not even mention the puzzles. The clock puzzles in particular are annoying as hell; if you can do those without using a clock puzzle solver on the internet, good for you. I could not.Similar to other games of the genre, it does have annoying sequences of boss-fights without intermediate saves.Annoyingly, the entire game is based on random encounters. You might be able to just keep running and the monsters might loose you and despawn, but that doesn't always work and it's always annoying anyway. Later in the game they are giving you an option to raise or lower the frequency of these encounters, but again... it's late in the game, and it's another hidden feature.The DLC content is unremarkable, and probably wouldn't be worth the price if it wasn't already included in the game. I have completely ignored the colloseum, and I have save-scummed the gambling DLC (primarily because it gives some origin story for a character from the game, and since I was already on it I finished the main part of the DLC as well). There is one DLC that actually related to the main story, but it's boring since you have to do the same fight over and over and over again, with a new and completely separate character, until you can 5-star both fights. It's basically a starting and ending cutscene, with a boring grindfest in between.Also, the technical quality of the game is horrendous. While I played XIII ""out of the box"" with no problems (although that was on Win7), I had to install 3rd party patches to avoid the crashes here. And I don't think I ever got the surround sound to work properly -- there are no settings, and having a surround system would somehow move the voices in cutscenes to positions where they are way too quiet to understand behind the music. Even if the speaker is in full view... so, I actually had to set my syetem to stereo for the time being.On the positive side, after applying the 3rd party patches, I only got one crash in the entire playthrough, leaving only the sound bug to contend with.The production quality is good. I think I got more impressive cutscenes back in XIII, but that's about it. Compared to most other JRPGs I've played, this is still a whole other level.",Recommended,

The quick fix is to disable this function. Sounds good?Well, if you already created a savegame and played for a few hours before encountering the first crash, you're out of luck: If you disable cloud saving then, you cannot use your original save game anymore, so you can start anew from scratch (EDIT: You can manually copy savegames to the right offline directory, though, but still, I find this kind of having to workaround the issue unbearable).I realize that this is a console port, but if Square is not able (or willing) to provide a proper implementation of cloud saving, they must not offer this feature in the first place - much less activate it as a default.That they actually have the audacity to leave such a critical (or rather: blocker!) bug unfixed for years leaves me speechless.What leaves me even more speechless and makes me really angry is that they already had a perfectly smooth implementation of cloud saving for final Fantasy 13 which I used dozens of times over dozens of hours of gameplay and which never ever crashed (at all).The game itself may be good (even great), but can I reccomend it?No - not even remotely. Simply for the reasons stated above and I am not even beginning to factor into account that multiple other users have had additional stability problems with this game. I purchased this game with hard-earned money and I naturally expect this to work out of the box. I am not interested in modding it or working around issues in my spare-time.EDIT: And now, after having finished the game, I cannot help but stick to my initial disrecommendation. Without going into too much detail for this quick review, suffice it to say that the combat mechanics when compared to FF13-1 have been reduced in complexity, the story generally allows for interesting plot twists but turns out to be too weird and totally unsatisfying in the end. In addition to that, eidolons / espers have been removed from the game (which I find truly sad) and the balancing of the game - especially in the end is off. While the devs made a few things better than in FF13-1 (less corridors and more open areas), FF13-2 still falls behind its predecessor in the more important points. Take that and add some unnerving clock / collect item puzzles and you end up with a mediocre game at best. Sorry - my disrecommendation still stands even apart from the crashes initially mentioned.",Not Recommended,

Exploring the world is much better though due to the environments no longer being restricted to a straight line.The storyline is quite confusing, and does not flow very well throughout the entire experience due to the nature of having a plot largely involving time travel. The main characters are quite dull to be around, very rarely will they have a conversation or interaction with one another that feels real, and the moogle character that hangs around with them has a really annoying voice. As for the performance of the game, while I didn't encounter any serious bugs or crashes, the frame rate was quite poor throughout the experience.

With tons of included DLC and post-game content there's an insane amount of extra hours worth of gameplay after you kill the big baddy. The storyline while awesome does feel built around the time gate mechanic instead of the other way around.What I mean by that is that the story comes in chunks rather than in previous FF's that tell their story from A to Z as you play. It's a bit tough to explain but on the plus side, it's always exciting to see another storypart revealed.Visually it's great, as expected. The audio is bloody fantastic, with great music and even the US voiceovers (of the 2 protagonists especially) are very, VERY well done. Combat is expanded upon compared to FFXIII, with an extensive catch-'m-all monster (and infusion) system, and a blast to behold.The Crystarium, one tip, don't just level it!

You can actually become either very powerful or gimp yourself hard if you just level your roles without second thought.I'm on a Radeon 4870HD card and 1650x1080 (my max res) was playable but smoother in 1400x900, which is the resolution I've ended up using.I still need to upgrade to a modern card someday so I can't confirm or deny any performance issues with this game.Mind you, I finished FFXIII before the release of the gfx options/FFXIII-2 on 1650x1080 without too much graphical stress.

I read that this game fixed a lot of the problems of the first so I gave it a bash not expecting much.This is leagues ahead of the first game.  It's back to more traditional Final Fantasy elements - proper exploration, side quests, interactive story, secrets and MOG!  I was thoroughly entertained by this game and I loved the little surprises it has!  The after-game coliseum, I can tell you, is a REAL treat for old timers of the series (very old timers, think pre-playstation).  There's Chocobo racing in a Gold Saucer tribute location along with other mini games.  Especially loved the poker!  I really appreciated the addition of Mog.  He brought humour to the rather heavy storyline.  And when the Government gives him tissue instead of Gil?  Priceless. He was just yet another nod to the fans.I was really impressed by the voice acting - especially of Noel.  Music is great too.I enjoyed Hope's character development in this one.  He annoyed me quite a bit in the first game although I warmed to him as he matured toward the end of the game.  In this installment he has fully matured, both physically and mentally and it's lovely to see how he has turned out.  He was definitely my favourite in this.The downside is perhaps the story.  Although time travel gives this game the tools to be free for the player, it has made the XIII universe more complicated than necessary.  It often leaves more questions than answers and many things simply don't make sense.  It is better than the first game, but then it surpasses that in almost everyway.  The ending is also an epic troll - be prepared to play Lightning Returns for even a chance of satisfaction.All in all, I would recommend this game, especially if you got through the first - this is your pay off.",Recommended,

Some hate it. If you dig your RPGs to be a little more action-oriented and faster paced, XIII-2 will be right up your alley (after you play through XIII first as this is a direct continuation of that story line.)For a game from 2012 built for hardware from 2006 it's a pretty game. Sadly, concerning the graphics/performance of this title is my big, and only, gripe: the PC version is not well optimized and has some pretty wacky stuff going on.You'll notice that the features of the game specify that the title sports a 60fps framerate and that's technically true, but misleading in how one would expect. First of all, you're going to need a decently beefy rig to play this game smoothly at 30fps due to the pitiful optimation for PC. Second of all, yes, you might hit 60 fps here or there, but the internal engine applies restrictive frame limiters at multiple points so don't expect that frame rate to stick.Any cutscene shot that focuses on Noel runs nice and smooth at 60. Shift to Serah or any other character? Hard drop to 30. Running around the map at a nice 60 before it loads a new area and you've got another drop. Battle start? Drop to 30 until the victory animation, then snap back to 60. My system is not being taxed, mind you, it's just how the game operates, which is disappointing. XIII did not have this problem on my end (save for some cutscenes that were hard-limited to 30 fps here and there).The soundtrack is amazing - wide variety of styles and genres. There's plenty of tracks that hit the right emotional beats to go with the story and lots of great blood-pumping battle tunes to get you into the fight, ready to take on the world.The story is great, not entirely needed as a follow up to XIII as it feels pretty shoe-horned in to make some more money, but it's serviceable and enjoyable. It's nice to play as the damsel in distress from the first game and Noel is a good companion and a welcome addition to the cast.Fun RPG, great experience, and while far from being the PC port it could have been, it is the superior version to the console editions.",Recommended,

Cyn,12.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968247428/,"June 10, 2022",6,"I started off really enjoying XIII-2 and I began playing it immediately after having finished XIII.Unfortunately this promising start is betrayed. There is a serious lack of compelling characters in your party - literally it's just Serah and Noel and then the third slot is made up from whatever trash mobs you unlock through battle.  The story and it's delivery is almost entirely different from XIII - it is a completely fragmented trip through segmented areas and points in time, often overlapping and it feels like a spaghetti mess to try to figure out where to go next or what to do.  Coupled with the necessary back-tracking it makes progressing through the story a total chore. Also the Crystarium has been, imo, unnecessarily reinvented.  This time for your two characters you are spending your CP points for all your specs across constellations, rather than having individual trees for each role. This feels on the surface to allow more options to spec in to other roles, however picking up a new role does not seem to provide any discount to the early abilities, so it feels wasteful to explore in to a new role as you need those points to continue progressing your other roles.Performance isn't anything to brag about either.  It's still a good looking game, as is XIII, there are moments in both games that are visually stunning even today. However the game would experience periods of extreme frame drops both in combat and while exploring, when otherwise it's running maxed out at a locked 60fps.  I also made sure that I was going through the full upgrade/patching from the PCGamingWiki article.I got to a point in the game where I had two bosses in completely different timelines to defeat and both of them would one shot my main characters even when they are Sentinels.  It felt like I had to put a lot of effort in to unlocking minimal progress. The fragmented and disjointed time paradox of a story is so difficult to follow and the game knows this because it attempts to provide you a full recap of events every time you load the game and there are also long scrolling audio descriptions of every one of the games areas/time periods. I'm sure if I kept bashing my head against it I could figure it out, but I'm not sure I want to at this stage.I enjoyed switching out and re-calibrating my party in XIII to find the perfect strategy to beat bosses etc, but in XIII-2 this feels hampered by having to constantly level up new trash mobs to maintain your skills and abilities, some of which don't even learn the same spells.  I've been using the same healing mob since the beginning of the game because only one other Medic mob has been acquired and it does not seem to learn Esuna or other useful spells, at least as I can see it now.  Again, the game is attempting to answer criticisms of the first game (being too linear, not having enough options etc), but failing in it's execution.Can only recommend this one if you are obsessed with XIII and desperately want to play through to see it all - otherwise just watch a story recap. I really enjoyed XIII - Lightning is probably my favourite FF character - but to me it feels like the fixes for the ""broken"" elements in the first game actually detract from the enjoyment of the sequel :(",Not Recommended,

PunisheR,77.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/andrefgpinto/,"May 3, 2016",6,"I would like to start my review by saying that .I remember trying Final Fantasy VII in PS1 when I was a kid, but it never motivated me to play it.So about Final Fantasy XIII-2, if you have never played the first game of the trilogy ""Final Fantasy XIII"", stop reading this review (or any of this game) and first try the game number one. Because it's the continuation of its story and an ""evolution"" of the game mechanics. You will only understand and possibly enjoy it by first experiencing the first game and I don't want to spoil you in any way.I've played this game and the first on PS3, after I asked for a friend to borrow me Final Fantasy XIII and felt in love by it for some reason, and decided to buy it and got addicted. I finished the main-storyline on both games on PS3, but then... PC gaming happened.I read some reviews and comments about Final Fantasy XIII-2 performance about the PC version and let me tell you, I was a little afraid that I would buy it and not being able to play it.Now look at my profile and you will see, not only I played it for  but I also .So despite of what people are writing on the media, gaming portals, such as steam, here is a proof that the game does not suffer from any crashes or slow gameplay.It does suffer from some frame drops, but only on some battles, and only for some seconds,I only had frame drops, on 3 boss battles though.And yes I know people with high-end computers (like GTX 900 series and i7's) are having crashes and frame drops on even just exploring the maps and my only explanation to that is the lack of acknowledge of those people in configuring their systems for proper gaming.In 70+ hours my game , and I played with my PS3 controller all the time. I Alt+tabbed numberous times, I streamed the game on twitch and I even used the steam web browser while ingame.But enough of technical review, if you really liked the first game and its story, you will certainly like this one too.The game battle is pretty much the same, the exploration and battle encounter has changed and the free roam is completely different.Because of the storyline, you can go back and forth through the maps from the main menu.The system to upgrade your acessories is no longer by EXP, instead you craft them now.Also the items you equip system has been tweaked to improve the tactical aspect of the game.Since your main characters are only two (again because of the story), you can tame wild monsters to be in your party and evolve them as you need and want.You can make them super-powerful as magic but weak on HP. Or vice-versa.Just like the first game and like many others Japanese RPG's, this game takes a lot of grinding for you to get certain items, levels or monsters.The DLCs that you could buy in PS3 store (for example, to have Lighting in your party - otherwise she's not playable) it's totally free on steam, because it comes in when you buy it.Needless to say I annihilated the last boss and some achievements by just using Lighting power.I don't want to spoil the story or anything, but if you did a research, the story will not end in this game - and it actually almost brought a tear in my eye the first time I saw the ending. If you want keep knowing what happens next, you will have to play Lighting Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, which is the third and last game of the trilogy.The price is still a bit too high for its quality and I disliked some new ideas that they brought into this game, like the ""Hands of Time Clock Puzzle"", or the Casino Coin mini-game.8,2 / 10",Recommended,

🎀🌈Yuer’s🍇🍫,183.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/scarletswancloude/,"August 16, 2019",7,"Now I can safely say “I don't know whether I can recommend this game or not, kupo~~~” Since Steam insists not giving a neutral option for a game recommendation, I can hardly adjust this game's value by a fair feeling. You can ask if I“like”this game or not, I can give a straight answer, but recommend to someone? No, I have no idea about the tastes of the readers are, and by far, Final fantasy XIII-2 is amazing at some point; however, it also has massive flaws that I just hated every minute of playing them. It is very difficult to judge a complex game like this by simply overall using ‘Yes” or “No” options in the end.Before I get myself started, I want to point out: this review will be different from my major reviews on steam; I will compare Final Fantasy XIII-2 to its predecessor (Final Fantasy XIII) along the way in hope to give a detailed picture of how this game evolved, and its position in XIII's trilogy. There isn't any meaning to put FF XIII-2 within the entire FF games in comparison, since each FF game is completely different and the timeline would be too long to discuss; and FF XIII-2 probably by far, won't at the top among its ancestors. Positive Facts & Major ChangesStory- in my personal opinion, FF XIII-2 got better story than XIII, more interesting story-telling methods meanwhile carries the legacy XIII has left on its own ending. There is no doubt that FF XIII-2 is the true sequel of FF XIII regardless.Brand-new System-this probably is the most praised part of the game, since XIII-2 is a lot more customized than XIII refers to how you proceed the story (open world maps); how you raise your team members in favour of your own strategies on battle. The game basically gives the players a lot more freedom about 'how you wish to play' and 'what you are going to discover willingly'. It is another step forward comparing to XIII in sum.  MC-Monster Leveling System- it is arguable this system is a big step forward or backdrops in general. It has its positive side, meanwhile bearing some flaws at the same time. I've put the positive tip here, also going to discuss its negative part in 'the flaw' section. In FF XIII, you have 6 protagonists to play through the entire story, and each one of them will eventually reach its exactly same maxed state, every gamer will get the same result no matter how he/she levels these characters, which also means the 3 party members fought on battle is also deadly set with the same states. In FF XIII-2 however, the 3rd party member on battle is replaced by a monster that you can tame from the wilds similar like Pokermon games. Your party on battle can have up to 3 monsters in action with endless number for diversity collection purposes. Each monster has its advantages and shortages. They all grow differently and follow its special 'hidden' rules, I say 'hidden' because in-game, it never explains clearly what is the best way that suits each catalog of monsters to level up. This massive change made XIII-2's entire leveling system stylised (since every player can end up unique party on his/her own depends on how he/she uses the upgrade materials) and complex at the same time. There are huge gaps between well-leveled party and poorly optimized ones. Memorable Soundtracks-Best on its own, no further description needed, carries some of the XIII's popular BGMs and created even more powerful and addicting new ones. Listen to them, you will know why I love them this much. FlawsToo Complicated Leveling System-Customized system would be a good thing; however, it also raised many problems at the same time. Because the in-game tutorial is simple and straight forward, it never reached its proper function by fully demonstrating the complexity of the“monster-growing”system along with the developments of the protagonists (Serah and Noel). How do they work in need to extend to their best potentials? What if the players are so desire? The result is: you either read multiple guides before you even start playing the game and carefully following them while playing (kinda spoil the fun by freely exploring the game) or playing the game blindly (like me), later to find out the situation could be so much better if you read a well-explained guide and knowing the natural rules of this complex customized leveling system for your team members on battle. Either way, there is no reset button in the game and this can't be good, but fall into a deep pit of flaws.    Irritable none-optional mini games-It supposes to be fresh and exchanging mood by implanting some cute mini-games within FF XIII-2, but it is never be a good idea to add a meanie (mini) game that purely winning by random AI's orders, chances from the gods maybe, with no other way around… No skillful play can fix it or needed; no alternative ways to go through it apart from thinking of using a cheat engine. What's worse, you're forced to play it until you won if you want to see the whole picture of the game, which means-you would be stuck with it for long if unlucky (like me again). Yeah, I am talking to you, Slot Machine! I don't know what the original purpose was by inserting this terrible idea into the game, but for me, it is a brick from the sky in FF XIII-2 for sure.   Frustrating DLCs- Now, if I've completed the whole game with nothing left apart from the DLCs with 180 hours or more were played, the very last thing I can expect from DLCs is more frustrating content of purely battles with super tough enemies to beat; in exchange for what? Have chances to recruit them to my party… Well, I'm exhausted after the entire long journey in FF XIII-2's world you see, and I've maxed out pretty much every single monster I need to beat the main game in completion including the also maxed-out Serah and Noel. Then, this DLcs tells me that your party is nothing ‘if you dare to challenge them.' Yeah, I admit that I lost interests half way after beating half of the enemies in DLCs, not worth it. I won't spend another hour to level them up even if I get their crystals by chance afterwards. There is not a single boss left in main game that I didn't challenge that I can test them out except the DLC battles. And I swear some of the battles you won't want to fight them again once you've done them, believe me. Instead, no real new story here, nothing fresh in general, the game would be much better without DLCs massing around, if you ask me.Alright, I think it is pretty much of it.Scarlet Score: 7/10 P.S If the devs knew where to stop, it could have been a 8/10, but with the horrible frustrating DLCs, yeah, yeah ,yeah, you got what I mean, don't you?

§єǫuєᴋʜaɴ ⚶,111.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Seqqeqeth/,"August 8, 2020",4,"FFXIII-2 does a great job of improving upon the gameplay of its predecessor. It is a direct sequel of FFXIII, although the story is radically different. Without giving away too much, there is some divine intervention - the results of which cause damage to the timeline, alters history and allows a select few to use mysterious Time Gates that have appeared throughout the timeline. Serah, with the help of Noel, a boy from the far future, is one such person.I loved the whole concept of how the story unfolds in this game. Instead of a world map, you get a Time Gate map, seen from outside time, where you can pick and choose places (and times) to go to, based on what gates you have unlocked. Granted, there is going to be some recycled content in terms of maps, but there are quite a few new ones so it doesn't grate on your experience so much. Academia is stunning in terms of its size, and it has probably the largest number of people you are likely to see at one time in a FF title that is not in a cutscene. Naturally, you can expect a framerate hit here.Valhalla is impressive as well, but sadly only available in the intro scenes, but Augusta Tower and Noel's timezone help give it some variety and new material too.Enemies are probably going to irritate some folks for its lack of new material, with maybe one or two new creations, and everything else having already existed from FFXIII. There is a notable lack of superbosses as well, unless you include the DLC battles, which partly helps to make up for this.But some of the best fun to be had with battles comes from the monster capture ability. Serah sometimes gets a monster crystal from defeated monsters, allowing them to be developed like a main character, and also allowing myriad customisation with the help of infusions, where you can feed a monster to one of your other monsters. You can have up to 3 monsters in your paradigm deck, meaning only those ones can be active in any given battle, and only one at a time (to fill out the team of Serah, Noel and a Monster).I find it weird they use the term 'monster' when most of the time they're just animals. Anyway.You can get some pretty crazy team combos, such as three different coloured chocobos. Chocobos are great fun, there's yellow, red, green, blue, purple, black, white, gold and silver. With so many different chocobos, you just knew there'd be chocobo racing too right? Some monster skills in combat actually stand for racing abilities when you enter the chocobo into the races, so there's another aspect to building your chocobos, that can be quite profitable too.With an achievement for filling out your bestiary to 100%, you're going to want to look up some guides to help you out. Monster infusions can be a bit confusing too with abilities having different ranks of importance, and terms like red-locked and yellow-locked abilities, so it's worth looking up some builds too where others have already done the work for you.Music is on par with other FF titles - I bought the soundtrack, and let me see... I have 36 or so favourites from this game, not the least of which are  and , the last of which is kind of death-metally, kind of funny. Typically an area will have music, then monsters appear and the music will elevate into a remix, which is a really neat idea.Character-wise, sadly there isn't much of Lightning unless you get her crystal from the DLC fight. She'll make an appearance here and there, but Serah is the main protagonist here. There's a few costume alternatives for her and Noel, but not much. There are brief cameos from FFXIII characters - most notably Hope - but the new villain of the story is probably the best part. Voiced by Liam O'Brien, one of my all-time favourite voice actors (who also voiced Kain from FFIV [the voiced version]), he has the sort of voice I wish I had.You can also play 99% of the game on easy mode if you wish! There is but a single enemy, Raspatil, that requires you to kill it on Normal, but you can change difficulty at any time during the game. A word of warning though too - on easy, there is no loot bonus for battles. On normal, you get a 200% bonus to items and rare items when you 5-star a battle, and even normal mode is pretty easy.A neat feature is the inclusion of minigames in the form of dimensional rifts. the games take the form of: join the dots (join the crystals of the same colour), collect crystals on a grid of tiles that disappear after you walk on them, and clock puzzles (which aren't nearly as hard as people make them out to be) where you have to land on each direction of the clock to finish the puzzle.With alternate paradox endings to unlock, funny dialogue choices to make (Serah gushing about Snow being totally cool in the first chapter is utterly hilarious), throwing your moogle to reach hard-to-get-to treasure, messing up the weather in Archylte Steppe, and having your chocobo flash enemies its butt to make them angry, FFXIII-2 has a truckload of things to keep you busy!* Now played 3 times to completion, PSN / PC / PSNps: Give your Giant Cactuar an electric guitar.pps: Give your Don Tonberry an angel halo.ppps: Give your flan an afro.",Recommended,
Conker,52.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047672025/,"February 3, 2017",29,"Well sadly this is a complete clusterf*ck of a port. One of the worst performing games i've played on PC. Right off the bat when you first start playing,  the game will (EDIT: you might get lucky and not have it crash on you) crash when you reach the first cutscene, the solution to this is to turn off the automatic steam saves. i still had a few crashes sometimes after doing that but it was playable.Also they messed the rain up on this release (it's too big, and looks ugly) there is a mod to make it smaller and look like it did on the console release though. Also the frame rate is horrendous, it would routinely drop to the mid teens for me during fights, there are mods and things that help improve the frame rate, but if you use them then when you reach a cutscene the audio will be out of sync...so weigh it, you either lose framerate or audio sync.If the PC is your only choice to play the game then it is playable once you disable the steam saves and tinker with frame rate mods, but if you have a PS3 or Xbox 360 then get it on that.As for the game itself, i thought it was pretty good, i did like the time travel aspect, but then i'm a sucker for time travel stuff. It can get annoying though if you are trying to get these side mission fragment pieces, you will have to travel to 2 or sometimes 4 different time zones of the same area to complete the mission, that's tedious. I gave up even trying to collect all the fragments (there's 160 in total, i have like 80 of em) eventually and just grinded away in fights until i was strong enough to finish the main game.A couple of things they improved over FFXIII are that the areas you explore are bigger, so they listened to the criticism, and also you can see the enemies before you fight them and also run away from them if you want, so you are not forced to fight them most of the time, unless they are faster than you and jump you.The actual meat of the game, the fighting they improved and made it faster and more streamlined from what i remember from FFXIII but there's only 2 chracters you play as in this, Serah and Noel. There are monsters that you can capture through battle and level up and infuse and combine with other monsters to create hybrid mega pokemon things that fight beside you in battle. I didn't do any of that, i had this one little light bulb looking guy who had an lightning ability with a green flower on his head who i maxed out, but i didn't combine him, i managed to finish the game by only using him on my team but he kept dying and i had to constantly resurrect the lil muppet. It's possible to complete the game without infusing them, but maybe learn from my mistake and look up some guides to find out which ones to infuse with each other and what not.The story itself is not very good, i didn't like how literally 2 seconds after the screen fades to black at the end of FFXIII they say time got all f*cked up and distorted and Lightning disappeared and Serah is the only one who remembers she existed. Not even a day passed!, that was stupid.Also kinda spoilers mebbe but not that much, the game can't really stand on it's own, if you haven't played FFXIII you will have no clue what is going on, i did play it and i still had no idea, i had a slight idea but not a fully formed one. There's actually text at the end of this that says ""To be continued"" FFXIII had a definitive conclusion, but i guess they decided to make this and Lightning Returns together, and the third one is in some ways even more out there than this one. Don't play this if you haven't played FFXIII and don't play it if you don't plan on playing Lightining returns either.Once you do finish the main story, more areas open up and also a coliseum where you can fight and recruit opponents like Lightning and Snow. I think some or all of this stuff is DLC from the consoles which is nice, but i dunno if i can be bothered messing with that stuff.",Not Recommended,

JLP101,60.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JLP101/,"August 13, 2017",11,"Rating: 6.5/10 Overview: Turn Based RPGThe Good:+ Good graphics+ Combat remains the same as FF13 with one major addition. You still assign roles to characters and switch between them freely during battle. This time however you can also assign your characters to attack single or multiple enemies giving you more flexibility in how to approach the situation.+ This game solves a lot of issues from FF13. The game starts much faster and almost everything is unlocked right from the start. Each area is interesting and requires exploration.  Leveling your characters is also improved giving you greater flexibility and more choices in how you want to develop your stats.  + The main addition is the ability to capture monsters and include them in your party. Every monster has a specific role and can be upgraded by using items rewarded after battle. You can also ‘infuse’ monsters together combing different abilities to make some truly devasating monsters.  + Given the nature of the game, there are multiple endings you can discover after completing the main game+ Collecting ‘fragments’ allows you to unlock options for the game, such as ‘fight more monster’ ‘collect more experience’  etc.  + The DLC content allows you to fight high level battles for those looking for a challenge. The Average:+/- Take the convoluted stories of a Final Fantasy game and add time travel and paradoxes. Despite the craziness of the story it surprisingly does a good job of holding the game together.  I also enjoyed the characters this time around. +/- Much easier than the previous game, I was able to complete almost all non boss battles without switching any roles+/- Many side quests are either fetch quests or kill a monster  +/-  The game features a few different logic puzzles. I found them enjoyable and add a little variety to the gameplay. However, if you decide to collect all the fragments you must complete many of these types of puzzles and they start to get repetitive.  The Bad:- One of the worst PC ports and optimization I have played in a very long time, especially for a game of this calibre. Regardless of system specs, maintaining 60 fps is near impossible, often times going well below 30 fps. You can use 3rd party apps to help alleviate the issue but this will cause a bunch of other problems. Now, let’s say you finally get stable framerates, you now have to deal with the crashes; crash after cutscenes, saving, battles, doesn’t matter, the game will crash and it will crash a lot. Before playing it is HIGHLY recommended that you disable steam overlay and cloud saving to help reduce the amount of crashing. -Game lacks exclusive full screen option, must edit the windows registry to unlock option.- no sound volume controls    - Heavy metal rock music during boss battles, it does not fit in with the overall theme of the game.- A character named Mog constantly saying Kupo!   Conclusion:Despite improving upon FF13 in almost every way its hard to recommend this game given its horrible performance and optimization issues especially during the first few hours of the game. This is one of my favorite JPRG’s and I loved a lot of the additions they added but I can’t recommend a game that gave me so many problems.",Not Recommended,

Drumbas,38.2,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055181574/,"February 17, 2023",7,"I absolutely hate this game. I think in the 38 hours I spent with it I enjoyed about 3-5 hours at most. The biggest highlight is the incredible music and the voice acting of one of the main characters (Caius). Liam O brien is a fantastic voice actor and he fit the role perfectly for the only interesting character in the entire game.Lets go into a deep dive into why I hate this game and why I honestly think pretty much anyone should be avoiding this disaster.To begin lets talk about the games concept, its very rare for the final fantasy series mainline games to get sequels. FF 10 is pretty much the main example and that sequel had a lot of problems as well. FF 13 2 pretty much has some of the most horrific writing I have seen, Serah and a new character called Noel take center stage into a time traveling trip through the locations of FF 13. This is an excellent chance to explore the wide cast of characters and locations in the first game that didn't get explored including Serah which was such an incredibly important character to the story.Now tell me how in a 40 hour game with all these new characters you somehow developed none of them? Even the most interesting character basically gets left on a bunch of question marks once you finish the game. Every other character is downright horrible, especially the main characters. Serah has 0 personality and somehow shows less development here compared to FF 13 where she barely said anything for the entire game. Noel is just supposed to be a hero for heroes sake, he isn't interesting or built up, he is forced in for the sake of having a new character. And MOG, there is a moogle for no reason that follows you around, the game only barely gives a reason as to why he even is in the game. This moogle is the most ear grating thing ever and represents everything western fans hate about JRPG voice acting. MOG is a mascot character through and through and his KUPO will haunt me in my nightmares. All these characters have no proper role in this entire story, they exist for the sake of existing. The gameplay got touched on but has the same essence as the first game. Note I said touched on and not improved. The combat did become more fluid with less useless animations but the structure of battles has become much less strategic and much more reactionary. The main strategy comes from building a 3rd party member. Most enemies in the game can be captured and then turned into a 3rd party member, this can completely break the game depending on how you tackle this system. If you end up not understanding the system because of how confusing it can be then you end up slogging through the fights. If you even understand it a little bit you will end up stomping 95 % of the game until the final fights of the game, which for some reason are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare. I could do every fight in the game nearly blindfolded with the same strategy, but for some reason the final area required me to have practically extremely decked out characters even with me spending a bit of extra time on side content and grinding. Either way I was already starting to get bored with FF 13's battle system towards the end of the first game, by the end of this game I grew extremely tired of it.Also did time travel, monster party member and new main character sound overly convoluted and confusing? Yes? Well you haven't heard the start of it. This game doesn't have a proper vision of what it wants to be, it just wants to be everything ff 13 failed to be. It tries to be extremely open ended but has to repeat a ton of content and messes up the games balance as a result. It constantly throws random plot points and game mechanics at you to try and keep you interested. There are puzzle sections that just feels forced. The last area has a platforming section with timed jumps that are slow as hell. It has a ton of side content which you can completely avoid if you want. Some of these are things that FF 13 was lacking but overall the execution is horrible. So many annoying things were cleaned up from ff 13 that it feels mind boggling that so many other aspects were introduced and made so slow and boring. There are a lot of ideas here but clearly not enough time/budget to actually realize the complete vision for this game. Which is sad, so much of this would have been really appreciated in FF 13, especially some of the side content like a coliseum or the 'Golden saucer' style area. That extra content is also one of the few positives I see in this game and it is what allows the ending to somewhat make sense somehow, those who are fanatic about FF 13 might be able to find something there in that bonus content.Maybe I could enjoy this stuff a lot better if the games port also wasn't one of the worst I have ever experienced. I had to mess 2 hours before even playing the game with mods to try and fix this mess and it still is so bad that its more common for it to be lagging and stuttering then for it to just run normally. If you have any particle effect like rain or sand on screen you can say goodbye to your frames. Some people even reported corrupted saves which I thankfully didn't get. Overall this port is a joke and a spit in the face of the fans of the series. Every time you move between area you have to look at a loading screen for like 1 minute, this ♥♥♥♥ is unacceptable when you have to move between areas constantly especially if you want to do side quests. Even something as simple as achievements feel half backed and forced in with descriptions barely describing what you are supposed to do. I hate this game but I think those who enjoy this game should be able to play it on PC without these horrible issues. Even if I enjoyed the game I think I would still not recommend this game purely due to how bad the port is.And somehow maybe the worst thing for me is the story. It turned the relatively straightforward story of FF 13 into a mess. All the themes and character build up of the first game feels like it was spit out in favor of the new cast of characters. And what do these new characters and story line offer? 'Future' 'Heart' 'Kupo' 'Friends' 'Paradox' 'CHAOS'. I miss the personal interactions between characters facing a difficult problem, ff 13 wasn't perfect but it did a lot right in creating some emotionally gripping scenes. Those scenes also exist here but they are extremely rare. Its sad to see because I actually can see a lot of potential in the story, it is exciting to see where the world of FF 13 was going after its ending, but everything here just feels like a bad fan fiction more then anything else.I downright hate this game with every fiber of my body. It isn't only bad but it actively makes FF 13 worse and I actually kind of liked that game to some extend. This game wastes your time, it runs like crap, it is boring as hell. For a game that tries to teach you so much about the value of time it is ridiculous that it has this much filler content that just straight up wastes your time. I can't ever recommend this game, even if you want to play all mainline FF games like me I would just recommend seeing a youtube summary or something and avoiding this. I entered with not a lot of hope and left with a disgusting after taste somehow. The only people I would ever recommend this to are those who 100 % completed FF 13 and still somehow wanted more, even to those I would give a warning to make sure you understand what you are committing your time and money into.",Not Recommended,

You will need many mods to try and keep this game running kinda smooth with only minimal issues.Now for the actual game, it's great! the combat is better and gives you more options than 13, the game isn't linear, the new characters are great and relatively well written, the story isn't... great but does the job just fine, the old characters are either no different or have been very much improved and lastly you can have little monsters fight with you like pokemon which is amazing. Honestly I didn't love 13 but I really enjoyed 13-2 when I finally was able to play properly and without many issues however although I'm giving the game a positive review I would be giving it a mixed review if I could as although the game is really good this port is god awful and honestly unacceptable, like they couldn't even mix the music, background noise and voices correctly (There's a mod to fix that) like seriously square it's honestly pathetic But yeah if you're willing to fix the game up you will be having a good time with lovable characters, amazing music and beautiful visuals so it's a thumbs up from me",Recommended,
Mr. Matt,103.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/magusx777/,"July 2, 2016",12,"This game was quite a disappointment for me. It took me two attempts to finish it: one on PS3 but I got bored and stopped playing, and the other on PC, the latter of which I was successful in completing after a fair amount of forcing myself to keep going. Despite really liking FFXIII while still recognizing it has weaknesses (for me, it was plot holes and post-game stuff), I could not enjoy FFXIII during the great majority of my time playing it.Where to begin? This is a port, so let's talk about that first. It runs -terribly- compared to FFXIII. FFXIII ran like butter for me, while FFXIII-2 was choppy and near-unplayable on the same PC until I installed a user-made 30 FPS capping app from the Steam discussion page. After that, it was a little choppy still, with character lip synching off by a few seconds, but it was definitely playable. The controls and everything else about the port were just dandy for me.Do not play this if you haven't completed FFXIII or at least watched all the cutscenes from FFXIII, as it would be very confusing otherwise. Speaking of confusing, villain's plan isn't described well enough to make total sense, nor is much of the storyline, with plot threads such as Mog's origin and why people from a survival-focused era when less than 10 humans are left on the planet would wear stylish, ornate, colorful clothing in a barren wasteland, fighting for their lives, wanting to survive. It would be like if Rick and friends on The Walking Dead were decked out in bling, bright blue parachute pants, etc., while being pursued by zombies. The female lead in the game magically gets new clothing and there is no explanation as to why. The female lead should've just had a new outfit naturally, since she's living in a full-on civilization, and the male lead could get the magical clothing to replace his rags, but instead the writers chose to lack all logic with this decision. Now, many humans can suddenly use magic, whereas before, it was only l'Cie that could do it. I actually liked that plot point in FFXIII, so I would have preferred that only l'Cie and ex-l'Cie can use it, because only one human in the entire game would need a writing modification to explain why that character can use magic. Only ONE. Changing the rules of the lore is just weird and unnecessary. One major character from FFXIII becomes a l'Cie in FFXIII-2, but you never see it happen, it doesn't seem to have any importance in the storyline, and you never hear any resolution to it or see that character in the ending despite that character being one of the most important characters in the universe for one of the heroes.Also, the ending of the game can be pretty aggravating/upsetting/disappointing. I didn't upset me anywhere near as badly as Mass Effect 3's ending, but it's gotta be in my top 10 most disappointing endings if I bothered to make such a list. I didn't believe another reviewer who claimed that the ending would piss me off, and I regret it. That reviewer was absolutely right. I honestly recommend that you just watch all the cinematics and cutscenes, which you can watch spliced together on Youtube. It would've saved me 50-something hours, at least.This game has a battle system which is almost completely identical to FFXIII's. The only biggest differences are that battles are random with the player being able to slash the opponent to start with haste and part of the enemy's stagger bar filled. Oh, and you use the male and female lead, and a monster as your third party member. You can use almost any monster in the game, but each can only do one role in the paradigm system, and you have to feed items to the monsters to level them up, which ends up being a time-suck if you want to make a really good monster. Much of the time, my human characters were lords of war when I was in a fight, while my monsters were just sucking badly. This game was also much, much easier than FFXIII for me as well, and I'm pretty awful at this kind of game. The final boss was annoying, but other than that, I didn't even have to try on most of the bosses, and I just set my team to all Commandos for every non-boss fight, winning within 20 seconds or less after about 55% or so completing of the game's story. This game might just have the worst experience scaling of any FF game I've ever played, because half-way through, fights were giving me 400-440 XP and those encounters were nearly twice as frequent to pop up as the rest of the game's random battles, which gave more like 225 XP per fight.The music was very similar to that of FFXIII, with a few reused songs here and there, and a few songs that I really disliked which probably would be classified as metal, which isn't really my thing. I liked the voice acting as well, except for the villain, who came off a bit too melodramatic for my taste.There is a casino, which sounded cool, but the interesting-sounding activities are locked off as DLC (it's including but you can't use the DLC until you finish the game's entire main storyline), and everything else either requires a lot of time (Chocobo Racing which most players say is garbage compared to FFVII's), or is all about randomness, which is the slot machines. To get items I wanted from the casino slots without wasting my life away, I had to clamp down Tab on my keyboard for hours and walk away while it autoplayed, reloading my game if I didn't make money. The casino in this game just wasn't fun for me.Last but not least, this game does have a post-game. That's not really my bag, but I did try to collect all of the Fragments (hidden objects in the game), and got 122 of 160 of them. I called it quits when I got about 85% through the story and a quest-giver basically tells your ""Lulz. The writers could've written this in somehow within your first hour of playing so you could prepare and not have such a daunting task, but screw you! I need you to fight every type of monster in the entire game including weird fights that you do for choosing incorrect dialog options during the storyline, etc., and you will likely have to consult an online guide and spent countless hours to get my Fragment,"" but I'm paraphrasing his lines from memory. Seriously, what a jackass move. And is it worth it? Getting all of the Fragments? At least half of my time at my computer with this game was spent getting Fragments, and all they do is give you some data files you could just look up online, help you get the secret ending (just watch it on Youtube after you finish the game) which makes a lot less sense than the original and still has the bad things happen that might anger you, and boosts the stats of the two lead characters. That stat boost, though? I had 122 Fragments, which gave me 40 higher attack attribute scores than I would have if I'd used the next best weapons which were on sale at the normal stores for CHEAP. My attack attribute was over 1100, so losing 40 points just wouldn't have mattered except when going for post-game optional bosses.In summary, the game has a pretty good soundtrack, a competent battle system with a third ""party member"" that disappoints unless you're willing to put in a lot of time, a so-so story with an anger-inducing ending, a crappy casino, hellish amounts of busy work to find all the Fragments, and a secret ending that's a complete let-down even though I didn't do all the work to get it. I cannot recommend this game, but I would say that the 7 hours it would take you to watch all the cutscenes and moviews from it in Youtube would be worth your time if you believe me and other reviewers that the ending really does deliver a low blow, and you were a big enough fan of FFXIII that you care to see what happens next (though Fal'Cie and l'Cie are rarely brought up and most FFXIII characters have very little screen time).",Not Recommended,

DetectiveFail,18.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GamerFail/,"July 8, 2016",7,"You repeat the same action, expecting something different, something new, something fresh. And after repeated tries what you finally create or destroy is something entirely different but remarkably similar at the same time. A creation of something new, from ages past, a relic to be used once more. FFXIII-2 epitomizes such qualities in a manner that takes what their predecessor had previously done and made some in my eyes welcoming changes.It should also be noted, since the game is different from the first, some things remain the same. And since the game draws heavily from time-traveling expect lots of questions and eyebrow raising as well.No more will players be restricted to one path throughout the game like the previous. Areas are more fleshed out with quests! Involving a lot of back tracking in order to complete them in order to earn CP (Crystogen Points) which is used to upgrade your characters in the Crystarium. Players who played the previous installment will remember this as their go to way to leveling up their character. Usually by battling to accrue CP (or exp) or doing side quests to earn more CP and unlock Fragments. And oh boy, Fragments and artifacts; you will hear this in the story a lot being heard. Basically in it’s most basic form, their a plot device that you need to progress through the story. Using the items above one can traverse through time in different eras called AF(After the Fall), from 5-700, don’t be alarmed though the game doesn’t make it like after 5,6, 7, 8, etc. You will only visit relative and important eras spanning different areas to explore. An interesting twist with Time-travel is the addition of paradoxes and alternate timelines which the game heavily abuses to see different areas dramatically change in setting and thus irrevocably change. The power to reverse such paradoxes is up to you mainly. But, I found the different eras in different places pleasing and a welcome change. Exploration has been revamped coinciding with side quests so expect a lot of backtracking to either farm for CP, materials, and even a chance of taming a creature. Whereas before you can only go forward in the story for the first game, here you can keep going back and restart eras to replay the events prior to see it all again.Hell, there’s even a casino area and chocobo racing which i felt was rigged against me. Or I just suck badly...A new mechanic reminiscent of capturing Pokémon, or Digimon; upon battles you have a chance to tame the creature you are facing these creatures range from smallest to large creatures you primarily face in the FFXIII universe. Of course each creature you tame can also be infused and made stronger using another creature to boost their capabilities if their compatible enhancing their role, adding new abilities or even adding resistances. They can also be leveled up using items compatible for them different from CP using items like potent chip, potent slivers, etc. These items can be bought from shops or earned as drops from battles to enhance your creature quickly eliminating the need to grind them. Each item is different, and can be used to upgrade their hp only, their magic only, or both. Some creatures are unique and can be tamed enabling strong party members while others you can’t tame like bosses for instance or some creatures like C’eith.The battle system remains the same with paradigms and roles Commando, Ravager, Sentinel, Medic, Saboteur, and Synergist. However, with the new creature mechanic you can expect a lot of new experimentation to create your own team that suits you. Coupled with the creature taming it provides a diverse and fun way to hunt for new companions to suit your battles and become stronger. Fan of the old will immediately be familiar with the same battle mechanic with the same o’l ATB rate, but this time you can unlock your roles via Crystarium and unlock more ATB charges and boost your roles upon completing a round in the Crystarium. It pleasant needing no introduction to the battle system with several new additions to the system with taming.Story-wise with Time-travel usually gives me headaches to understand the convoluted sense of the story, but in this game they don’t make it overtly complicated raising the right questions that will sooner or later be understood in the progressing story. What really changes the story up are the dialogue options during events only four choices to depend on what you will say. And these events will pop up again and again to inform the player of important events. I’m guessing it all lodges back into paradox endings you can achieve. Quick time events are included with this sequel in order to gauge player choice. Usually within a cinematic event you are prompted with QTE to progress through the story. Completing them rewards items, while not completing them makes you restart the whole progress. And while it can be annoying to wait for the button prompts the events were short and not so much that it was intrusive and bothersome. Some QTE are unique in providing a choice of a certain different path to take than a usual previous route.You play as Serah, the sister to Lightning from the previous game in a race against time really to solve paradoxes, with the adorable Mog which you can torture by throwing to various places to pick up items, and reveal hidden items in the world. But, wait there’s more! A future guy also travelled back in time to help you because you need a partner. His name is Noel. And you in essence share the leader role with him. Meaning you can switch from running around the world as Noel or Serah or face battles as Noel or Serah! While it sucks I can’t change them to be just creature parties I found the cast to be likable and sympathetic to their cause to save time and reach Lightning in Valhalla. In true Final Fantasy fashion you can even customize your creatures and outfit Serah and Noel in different attire (Moogle too!) and guess what even your creatures can have certain adornments on them you find in the game or buy. Music and battle themes some may remember some old sound tracks which fit the times you are exploring providing a soothing comfort and others new provide the tension to keep your body tense reading to spring into action. To compare FFXIII-2 versus its predecessor is like comparing a baby to a child. The changes in the game make it very diverse from exploration and taming, battling and side-quests and dialogue options and more. It takes the criticisms of the first installment and in my opinion improves it to make it better for the player to enjoy. While it may seem drastic to add many new mechanics and along with a new protagonist represents a bold risk that ultimately paid off.

This game is almost universally better than the first game in the trilogy. Combat is a bit faster and more streamlined, with an additional pokemon-like system that lets you use monsters during battle. Exploration is less linear, you can jump at any time, there's many different areas and everything is a bit more open. The soundtrack is fantastic as usual, and the story is about as much of a hit or miss as in XIII, though I personally love all of the characters and stories in this trilogy.The only fault of this game, as it were, is that it is part of a trilogy that debuted with a very mixed game. Final Fantasy XIII was linear, repetitive and restrictive until the 25 hour mark, but it had a setting, story and characters many people loved, as well as a rather unique battle system. Still, not many people wanted to play through the long initial linear gameplay loop and thus XIII got the reputation it, at least slightly, deserved.It pays off to have played it, though, as many events and characters are recurring in XIII-2. It also is nice to see the evolution the trilogy makes from first to second game, how every complaint is either solved or alleviated. Sure, it isn't perfect - the port in particular is very flawed when it comes to frame rate and performance, and the male main character is slightly irritating - but it is leaps and bounds better compared to XIII, which was a true flawed gem, though more flawed than gem. As someone who loves the trilogy, it's a great fun upgrade with returning characters, familiar and new locations, newfound freedom in environments and movement and an addicting gameplay loop of improving main characters Noel and Serah through the (now better) crystarium and collecting fragments as you jump through time and space to fix past and future. If you didn't like XIII, this might remedy the trilogy for you; but you should've at least played part of the first game first.Personal rating: 8/10.",Recommended,

It's not linear anymore, the battle system is slightly better and you can also catch some monsters and make them fight for you.Music is phenomenal again, but that's probably nothing surprising. FF series always had great music.The only thing that is not so good in this one is, sadly, story. It is even more confusing than before, but I still found it pretty enjoyable. Even though there're not so many characters, but the main villain is awesome. Also the Japanese dubbing is fabulous, by the way.The port is bad as always, and the game has problems to run even on 30 FPS. I did not mind that much.

The Story: Some people found it easier to understand, others didnt. I personally found the story in this game a complete mess to the point I stopped bothering. FFXIII did require a lot of reading for full comprehension of what was going on but after that, everything made sense. The world, the terms, the objectives, characters motivations. None of that happens in this game. Yeah, you can sum the story with ""oh, we gotta save the world and there's time travel"". But everything around that is so.. confusing. Most of the things that happen in this game are explained with ""because yes, we wanted a sequel so we made up a bunch of things that were never mentioned before"". The Characters: FFXIII had a super boring party... individually. The strong point of FFXIII was the interaction between them. Most of them didn't know each other and didn't have the same objective. However, they shared the same fate and decided to stick together. That made their interactions more interesting. Everyone was different and there was always conflicts between them. FFXIII-2 has Serah and Noel. Negative charisma for both. I didn't care about either and their motivation was also... eh meh. Not well developed.World: Welp, I liked what was stablished in FFXIII and the world of Fal'Cie. In this game they just decided to play along with alternative realities post Fal'Cie and it didn't please me at all. There's nothing to get attached to since you are constantly changing timelines. None of the timelines really matter enough for you to care. You are not playing a ""world"", you are basically different neighborhoods.Combat is better/faster and the ""pokemon catch"" thing is nice tho.",Not Recommended,

Clockwork,54.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007746395/,"May 14, 2022",2,"First of all, before buying this game, I read some reviews mentioning it had many crashing/compatibility issues. Only one review mentioned that it seemed to work better on Windows 7 than on Windows 10.So far, I've been playing on Linux Mint using Proton 7 and it's been working flawlessly; save for the frame drop when there's a lot of particles/lighting on some specific occasions, such as cinematic or boss fights. Otherwise, the game runs perfectly fine.~~~~~~~~~~Gameplay wise, when you start playing it, you'll realise that it plays a lot like Final Fantasy XIII. The fighting system is the same, the controls are similar, the menu works the same way, the map works the same way, save for a few minor differences: - You actually have a button to physically jump. It's not really useful most of the time, save of when you have a blue jumping circle like in the first game. But if it allows you to jump a tiny cliff instead of going all around, it's nice. Combined with the Chocobo that allows you to run faster, it's almost like platforming.- Some fights (mostly boss fight) require you to perform actions during ""cinematic fights"". Basically, you will be asked to press on a few buttons or move the direction stick (if you play on controller) a few times within the given time.  Pro tip: you can pause the game by pressing start until you can recognise what you're supposed to do. That will make ""cinematic fights"" easier.When I started playing, I felt like it was going to be what FF X-2 was to FF X, albeit with a better start and an actual plot. But the game quickly took a bad turn, at least in my opinion. Everything I do feels frustrating, as if the very fact of playing the game was a chore; a bad one.In the first game, whenever I had to farm (experience, money, anything), I actually felt like I was progressing, getting somewhere. In this game, it feels like it's going to be a pain either way: farming takes forever, and if you don't farm, then the game is going to take forever too. There is a main plot, as weak as I find it. But it's not really what drives the story forward. You're just randomly advancing forward, hoping that you will eventually get somewhere in the story.The music, more often than not, is annoying. From time to time, you will get the music from the first game, which gives you a good moment of nostalgia. But the music of this game itself makes me want to wrap this up even faster than the game itself.Overall: it feels like it had potential to get somewhere, even if I initially didn't understand why they decided to retcon the ending of the 1st game. But the way it was done feels like they were just trying to milk money out of the 1st game, the same way as with FF X-2.The thing I liked the most was when I realised you actually win money whenever you finish a fight, along with Chocobo racing that makes you earn things you can resell for a lot of money. It makes it easier than in the first game.Some people probably enjoy it. Personally, it's definitely not what I expected from a Final Fantasy.",Not Recommended,

The music is great and a step up from 13. The camera is atrocious in combat and not being able to set it static is just bad design. The story is serviceable and typical FF nonsense but with time travel now. If you can get this for 10 dollars, go for it.

<3,38.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chocolaowo/,"April 22, 2021",4,"FFXIII - 2 is an alright game. It's certainly worse than XIII, but it is not bad.The game play is almost the exact same as XIII, but with a few good improvements. You can attack an enemy before an encounter to get a bonus, rather than having to sneak up behind them. Instead of having 6 people in your party, you only have two, and can switch monsters out in a third slot. The Crystarium leveling system is imo a downgrade from FFXIII because it is hard to tell what leveling up gets you, but one good thing about is that it lets you build the characters more than XIII did.The story of XIII-2 is not that grea. It's hard to write a good time travel story. They did OK with it, but a lot of the time you'll be like ""oh come on."" The best part of the story is the relationship between Noel, Caius, and Yuel, and also Lightning and Serah, but it feels like you have to peel off so many other layers of the story till you get to the good stuff.The port of XIII-2 is worse than XIII, but if you use RTSS to cap the FPS to 30, set the GFX settings as low as you can in the launcher, and install LAA (found here  then its a playable experience. Make sure you have a controller too, or you'll get bad stuttering.Overall, if you liked XIII, I would recommend you play this game.

The characters are likable. You have towns! You have shops! You can revisit old areas, do side quests. You get some impressive in engine cutscenes.The only flaw of this game is that no matter how much you want to dress up FFXIII's brilliant combat, it's still not as engaging as XII, X, or the ATB-era combat systems.

AplJack,62.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040145517/,"March 31, 2015",2,"I'll start this review with the obvious, that I am sure most reading will have seen time and time again. Yes. The graphical capabilities of this game on the PC are untrue. It runs slower than 60fps, sometimes dropping quite low in more intense battles / larger view battles. This is nota fault of anyone's PC, but how the game was programmed with the PS3 in mind, a poor architecture. It does not make use of the full capabilities of GPUs or Multi-core CPUs, therefore it will run similarly on older computers as it might on a state of the art. The software is the limit, not the hardware.That said, I do have an older PC. I played in a 720P window at that resolution using the smallest shadow-map, and 2x MPAA. It ran alright for the most part. As I said, it had it's slow moments, but was hardly unplayable as some might have suggested. I do play modern games at post 60fps, but do not find low FPS to be a kill all. I could probably have upped the shadow and AA and still been fine. No crashes, no critical flaws to the game in that regard. I could have been lucky, but that was my experience.Now then, on to the game review itself. Would I recommend this game? Yes.The story I find rather touching, if a little too sappy at times. I don't find it really killed the story of the first, but rather fleshes it out. The combat remains quite close to Final Fantasy 13, which is a plus, albiet there are times when I felt it was overly easy comparatively(explained later). The 'time-traveling' and 'gate-closing' mechanics give you chances to go back and redo areas to complete them differently where available. Unlike Final Fantasy 10-2, you do not need to replay the game through from the start multiple times to see everything. You will need to replay sections, but so far nothing I have seen too much repeating. The world is definitely more 'open' than it was in the first game. There is more to explore than narrow hallways. Still very closed in spaces comapred to /world maps/ in the older games, but better.Now for the things I did not care for. ""Ease"" of Battles:Battling in 13 seemed a bit more tactical than it is in 13-2. I attribute this to the libra spell which you could cast at will in the first game. In this game, there are librascopes you can find or buy for exorbitant prices about mid-game, but no actual simple libra-spell to get data on monsters initially. This means the game can't be too harsh for not paying complete attention to the monsters while you fight them. Without foreknowledge of the enemies, you just have to constantly hit them until information is revealed, often through multiple encounters. If you don't avoid fighting a long way through the game, most your 'random' battles until the very end will revolve around three commandos just nuking everything with blitz and ruinga. Auto-battle will be used overall, as very rarely do you need to worry about selecting proper skills.Not to say that there are no times it's better to manually control, especially if less than ideally leveled, but mostly that revolved around me applying proper debuffs to certain enemies. In that regard though, I felt a lot of the battles could just be brute-forced compared to 13, with only a few that it really mattered to focus on it all. Many times, if you didn't care about time too much, having a strong sentinal member(not too hard to get early on, and upgrade later) could really ease it.Speaking of character classes... The '3rd wheel' as it were of your 3rd party member. Rather than a single character with multiple classes, you capture and raise various monsters for the roles. Each monster only has a single role, and you can only have 'equipped' 3 monsters at a time to fill various roles. For the most part, this isn't a big deal... Raising them isn't too specifric unless you need uber monsters to help the uber enemies situation. Even then, I don't see the value in perfectly upgraded partners.And speaking up upgrades... The crysterium is very lack luster to me compared to the first game. I liked how you could choose which class to level in what order in the first game, but each character would ultimately max out at a certain stat level when all was finished. In the first game, you had a max level for a given area, which forced more strategy on the player as they could no brute force it as much. This game? Regular battles are basically infinite CP batteries. You will be maxed well before the end of the game, unless you really rush. How you level though, is is a single crysterium for all classes on each character. Depending which class you level though at different points in the crysterium(including even/odd levels on some classes) gives different bonus stats. In short, there is an ideal way of leveling each character, while others could leave you with somewhat less than great stats, depending which all you leveled. Nothing game-breaking, but if you are a perfectionist, prepare to study and research ideal leveling order.Lastly, a few of the 'fragments' in the game are a real time-sink and pain to get. Grinding certain enemies to get a lot of gil to just dump. At one point, taping a button on the controller down on the slot machines just to make sure I win a certain amount over a few hourts while I browsed the web. Battling every enemy at least once, including rare enemies and some that have a 50% chance of not spawning at all on a run through an area before you have to reset the area and try again. Making sure to explore every last detail of every map for 100% completion. Just... tedium work, really.That aside, I do not regret this purchase. It fixes some of the problems I had with FF13, but introduces different naggings. Despite my naggins though, I felt compelled to play it through and enjoyed the ride. A few points that were dull busy work, but overall a fun game. Just be prepared to look to the next game if you want any sort of conclusion, because this one literally pulls a Halo 2 with a ""To Be Continued...""",Recommended,

This was the MOST negatively distracting and mood-killing addition to the game.-Only 2 playable characters.  As much as I loved Serah, gets boring yeah?-Sort of as an extension to the above point, but the gameplay is much more dry than it was in xiii.  In xiii I had the leisure to change up my team (after chapter10 that is), in this game I'm just spamming AOE spells or Ruinga.  (because combat was easier and buffing and debuffing didn't matter as much)-Dry character progression and feels like there is even less impactful equipment customization or choices than in xiii.-Interactive cutscene ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""press X' ""press Left"" why is squaresoft copying these type of uncreative AAA garbage game features?-Game is both easier and more tedious than xiiiOverall: since I really loved xiii, so I ended up enjoying this game still.  I really liked Serah and felt more positively about Noel than I did for half the cast in xiii.  But I did feel like this game did pretty awful in that it ruined the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me: atmosphere.  And it did that simply by way of the Random Encounters mechanic.  I just want to absorb the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scenery and music for longer than 5 seconds without monster battles appearing and interrupting the mood.If you played and enjoyed XIII for whatever reason, get this game.  Otherwise, don't, because this game is admittedly horrible.Personal score: 8/10 (from a guy giving xiii-1 a 9.2/10), deduct 2 points if you didn't enjoy xiii, and change this from a recommended to a non-recommended game.",Recommended,

Wolf Angelus TTV,39.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WolfAngelus/,"July 25, 2016",3,"In comparison to FF13, we are given a ton more free roam this time. The images on missions typically tell you where to go and for the story you just need to pay attention except about mid-game, you have to go through wild artefact portals till you find the right one which if you are unlucky, will be the very last one and make you go find more wild artefacts first. Another massive change is instead of having a large party, you play as either Serah or Noel and also have 1 animal companion which has its own rule, can be upgraded etc. Most encounters in the game can be turned into an assistant character for your 3rd slot.The story concept focuses on time travel and rifts so it can get very confusing but also a change to the typical Final Fantasy. The theme is what I would call despair, so it is more sad oriented rather than a happy fantasy and this concept is used throughout the whole story. You have the option to revert all progress in that map which is useful so you can never really mess up and only need to do a single play through + revert time to accomplish everything. The battle system is the same as FF13, just a more polished UI and for the most part, the game is easier and requires less grinding and there are less gaps in stats between you and the enemy. There are not many choices for equipment this time as the weapons you get are very linear and you just buy these from the store. The other equipabbles are accessories which each have a consumption value and you have a maximum value that you can fill up with accessories. There is no upgrading this time, so if any aspect of this game is linear, it would be the items you get.The music is what is truely amazing throughout the whole game and what really makes it enjoyable. There is an easy option so if you want to experience the soundtrack and just play the story, that would be a possibility.The puzzles... well the clock one can be really annoying and gets very tedious, there is a site on Google that you can put in the values and get the solution if these gets frustrating or tedious. The platform and connect the dots are more enjoyable.There are 2 technical issues encountered, one is the regular fps drops which is mostly during free-roam, so it doesn't ruin anything. Cutscenes and battles never were affected for me. The other issue is rather annoying and that is this strange super load static buzz when opening the game. A trip to google will give you the info on setting a certain file to admin which eliminated the noise.Overall it was fun for a playthrough, the music was the highlight of it all, the combat entertaining, story decent enough. Playing as Serah in her swimsuit was fun too. Noel can go away though, he reminds me of Sora from Kingdom Hearts with the voice of Tidus from FF10. Caius was cool.Personal experience score: 9/10Story: 8/10 - Can be confusing because it is based on time travelling between rifts, but it was something different and better than FF13. A lot more despair in this one though which is why it intrigues me.Sound: 10/10 - The soundtrack shines pretty quickly with some epic and intense music that rivals FF14 primal fights,Graphics: 8/10 - Great improvement from FF13 PS3 version. However it has quite a few fps drops while free roaming.Controls: 9/10 - Pretty much what you know from FF13, switching between roles for those large attacks can be annoying when you have to move fast and scroll through the list.Game Length: 10/10 - 40 hours of content about if you do a large portion of the adventuring and collecting. A bit more if you want to get max gear and do the super bosses in the colliseum.",Recommended,

Anyways, to review the fact that it is a port, it's not bad. It's crashed twice within a couple of hours (near the beginning of the second chapter), and has gotten slightly choppy in a few cutscenes (maybe 15-20fps). I have the game on full settings, which would be 1080p, 16xAA, and 8K shadowing. The main components of my system are...AMD FX 8370 Eight-Core 4.0GHzXFX Nvidia Geforce GTX 970 4GB16 GB 1600MHz RAMWindows 10 64-BitSo, seeing as how I can make almost ultra settings in the new Doom, it should've fully worked for a game several years old. It does, it's fully playable, it's just that the odd massive effect(s) can get in the performance's way. I'm setting compatibilty to Windows 7, so I'll update if it has a lack of crashing. I heard Windows 10 started it. EDIT: Still crashes. Not every few minutes or anything, but I think it may have something to do with autosaves.IMPORTANT EDIT: While inconvienent, there is a way to stop the game's crashing. Just disable it's cloud saving within it's properties in Steam. Never crashed again. How to fix the frames? Don't get cocky with your computer. I know, the game should be high-end friendly, but it isn't. Lower the shadow resolution (4K works decent for me). 8K can actually be a bit too crisp with shadows, so like PC Gamer mentioned, use 2K - 4K. As much as some complain about the graphics altogether, deal with it. Games are supposed to be fun, not just pretty. That's why I hate mentioning graphic quality when it's not necessary.The other problem with it's porting would be the interface/messages. Myself, and I'm sure many others, use the 360 controller. It works great. Feels just like the console. The problem is, the game doesn't care. It has a controller layout screen in the title's settings, but every in-game message will tell you commands for the keyboard. You'll have to realize that the in game controller showing setting will need to be changed, as well as the title (at least, that's the only way it worked for me). The keyboard controls look like crap too, so I fully recommend controller.Were I not to talk about it being a port, I'd give it a 9/10. Some days, I may change my mind and say 8/10, but it's still really good. It fixes the main-character-game-over problem from the first game, and adds a monster using ability. The random-enconter fashion it uses is cool to experience for people wanting somewhat old-game type random encounters (not exactly the same). The part about it I love the most is the reality/time travel. It's really neat to go to some of the same places in the future/past or after a different event happens that would change the future.Negatives? Well, you still have to understand a little bit about FFXIII. Like the Fal-Cie, the Cocoon, and so on. They're not too important, but it's just good to know some of these things in order to understand a few conversations. My reason for this being a negative is that I never came to understand everything in the first game, so recognizing it now, especially after a couple of years away from it, is hard. The other negative? Well, it has a sequel. A crappy one. I really want to explain my reason as to why I mention this, but that would involve telling a bit about the story, and I don't want to put out spoilers.Anyways, great game, recommend to any RPG player without a picky, Square-hating, closed-in mind.

BreakerBlues,50.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BreakerBlues/,"January 6, 2021",4,"Playing this game right after finishing a completionist run of FFXIII it's really apparent just how much they changed for the better compared to the original. The story pacing is much better and the plot isn't nearly as convoluted as the first game, your party is no longer a revolving door of people, side quests are varied and include more story rather than just being kill quests, and the endgame/postgame has a whole host of objectives rather than just farming turtles for hours on end for gil and cp.I wasn't sure how I would feel about monster capturing being introduced into the game but they're well incorporated into the gameplay. You can do as much or as little as you want to finish the story and even for the end/postgame objectives there's a bunch of monsters aimed at mid-endgame growth that require less resources to level but can easily help you conquer all end/postgame tasks for the achievements. And for those who really love monster capturing/raising there's a fairly in-depth system for raising and tweaking your monsters to build them out just the way you want.The devs also did a great job in adding fragment skills which are accessible as your collect more fragments and progress the game. These include: increasing or decreasing the encounter rate, increasing cp gain, and increasing monster capture chances among other perks. Having a system in the game to tweak playstyle preferences as a reward for completing side objectives in the game is a really great idea and something I think other JRPGs should implement more often.My one and only gripe with the game is the optimization. There is a great guide here on steam that provides solutions to fix or mitigate issues the game has but it's a shame that fan-made patches are required at all to make the game function as it should. A problem that cropped up somewhat frequently was reduced frame rate, it was never unbearable but it wasn't pleasant. Thankfully this only occurred in the most populated of areas even though I have a PC that's 4-5 years old at this point. During my roughly 50 hours of playtime I only had the game hard crash on me once after applying the fan-made patches, which I think is a pretty good shout out to the effectiveness of the fan-made solutions.All in all it's a shame that not many people played this game due to the reputation that the first game garnered from fans. But for anyone that enjoyed or didn't mind the shortcomings of the first game, or is even just interested in revisiting these games, XIII-2 was a very enjoyable journey from beginning to end and in my opinion worth checking out.",Recommended,

piwiw,94.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/piwiw/,"July 7, 2022",2,"I want to preface this review by saying that I love the Lightning Trilogy so much. I know that Square Enix bit more than what they can chew in creating the then-hyped Fabula Nova Crystallis category of games, one of which became a game wholly separated from the series. I was one of the people who saw the games as it is: a series with an overarching, epic narrative that spanned three games with a polarizing yet actually sensible RPG battle system, and an iconic, very shoddy camerawork that I eventually learned to block out as I read the menus and the incoming enemy abilities.With that said: Man, this port really sucks. I love that all the DLCs were there, but man, it's not a very forward-compatible port. At least Square Enix did attempt to fix NieR:Automata but this game I feel like there's a snowball's chance in hell that this game's eventually getting fixed. It becomes playable despite the massive framedrops in several instances (such as Aerora spam during Ravager mode, exploring Academia, and some generally downscaled and framelocked cutscenes)--but only if you actually went your way to install fixes and mods to make the game seem as fluid as it can be. If there comes a time where Square Enix actually decides to release a Lightning Trilogy remaster, that's the only time I can actually forsee that they'll get these games--both the original and this game--fixed.",Not Recommended,

The characters developed a hell of a lot, and I'm not just talking about Hope . They introduced a few new characters that added a lot more depth to the story, and the villian was by far way better than Barty (He's got a deep british accent and an epic theme!)The framerate was TERRIBLE at the beginning though! And I mean unplayable! BUT there's an easy fix for it that makes it run perfectly, so luckily that wasn't a real problem.

Due to this *get this game via a trustworthy key selling website.* Preferably one that doesn't get the keys straight from the games publishers. You deserve your enjoyment of this game if you really want it. Square Enix however DOES NOT deserve money for this botched and lazy port.This also applies to the original 13 as well.Now onto the game itself. While I refunded this product quickly I did play it on PS3 and this game is very much an improvement in pretty much all the categories from the first.Don't let the auto-battle command fool you.

MasochistTank,33.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasochistTank/,"July 12, 2023",2,"Certified banger, takes everything good about the first game and runs with it. No more going through 2 whole chapters before unlocking the game's primary mechanics, instead you'll find everything you need within the first hour and the rest of the game is spent trying to use and abuse those mechanics to get to the end. One new one that I loved is the monster pack system, which gives you a chance to recruit enemies to your party. They do a great job of making your party feel more personalized throughout, which is nice :) It also helps that the story feels a lot more immediate than the first game, with a more compelling villain than the one from the first game that gives the final boss gauntlet a lot more OOMPH. On top of that, the soundtrack is a banger, full of poppy, vocal tracks that make exploring feel all the more breezy. Oh yeah, this game has exploring too. I love 13, but going from its hallways to this game's open levels is going to make it hard to ever touch 13 again.My only qualms are that the visuals seem like they've taken a hit in some places and that the combat feels less responsive. If you queued up all your abilities in 13 Lightning would go as soon as her ATB filled. In 13-2 Serah and Noel feel like they sometimes delay their actions for up to a couple seconds after their ATB fills, which feels less punishing here because combat seems a bit slower, but it's still not good. It also makes the classic ATB refresh strategy way less effective, which sucks because that always felt good to do well in the first game. Oh, and the clock puzzles suck, if you're having trouble with them just search for a 13-2 clock puzzle solver, that's what I did.All-in-all it's a great game and has already cemented itself as one of my favorite in the franchise.",Recommended,

Unlike its predecessor, this feels like a JRPG. You can travel freely and are not restricted to a one-way street anymore. You get cities with NPCs roaming around. The battle system is not much deeper but with the new monster system, they added a cool feature. Unfortunately next to one active monster you only get two characters, Serah and Noel. Serah is sweet and lovely just like in the first game but Noel is your standard cookie-cutter JRPG hero with some neat details here and there. But one of the most important additions to the XIII series: The battle doesn't end when your active characters die. This time around it swaps to your other character and only if that one dies as well it is game over. So you have some time to resurrect your fallen party member. Too bad there are some mega attacks again that insta-kills your whole squad when you're lower than 70%-80% hp. But as far as I can say this is only in the last boss battle. Also, the grinding is less noticeable here because you have to backtrack every now and then. The problem is that at one point in the story you have to have enough keys to open portals to (what I thought at first) optional areas. Looks like some of them contain very important objects. And since you never know to what area a new portal will lead you to have to get lucky or own all those precious keys. And they are well hidden at times. All around the world are translucent objects and containers you can reveal with your Moogle. And oh boy they are hard to spot sometimes. Unfortunately, most of the side quests rely on this mechanic so I hope you have good eyes. But at least it got neat side quests. (I look at you FFXIII Archylte Steppe). Once again all levels look great with different looks and feel. They get rehashed but it's okay considering the plot. And yes story. Although it is muuuch better than Final Fantasy XIII´s mess of Fal'Cie, L'Cie and more it is still a tad convoluted. But because the story is sprinkled nicely in between the chapters and different areas I pretty much enjoyed it. The whole game just feels more complete and well thought out. Somehow the battles feel more fun, although they are practically random encounters. And the music is also fantastic again. A tad too much singing though but most of the time it fits. XIII-2 is in fact a huge step up from the first game but not a perfect Final Fantasy game. If you want to catch up on the franchise I would recommend skipping FFXIII.",Recommended,

No problems with my Windows 7 laptop with a GeForce GTX860M. Steam cloud sync works perfectly and I am able to play the game on both rigs perfectly, except for that one time when my internet was down and the cloud sync did not work (duh). You can play it offline and it will sync once you have internet again.Having a playstation controller is highly recommended to enjoy the game!! Don't listen to keyboard players who complain about a game made for a PS controller.Battle System: This is the best part of the game! As someone who has played FF6 - 9, the battle system of FFXIII-2 was extremely refreshing and challenging. Throughout the battles, you will need to switch between modes in order to damage, mitigate damage, debuff and buff your party, failing which you will just die. And die again. And again. Fortunately, when you die you will be given the option to respawn at the same point prior to the battle or retry the battle, which saves alot of time. Also, if you think you're gonna lose the battle, simply press start and retry to have another shot at it.You get a chance to tame monsters after you have defeated them. Catch em, level them and infuse their abilities to other monsters to create your own unique monster!If you're looking for a game that you could simply press O and you could cruise through battles with ease, this is not for you. Go play dota 2 or something.Levelling System: You earn crystarium points after battles or side quests and can use it to level up your party's crystarium, gaining new abilities etc. Level up wisely in order to maximise your stat gains!Story: The storyline feels kind of lame and slow at the start, but believe me when I say the character story developers did a fantastic job of making me have dem feels for both the protagonist and the villain. BTW, there are multiple hidden endings for the game if you can defeat / unlock them, or you could just youtube it if you're lazy.Sidequests:CHOCOBO RACING AND A CASINO! You also get all the additional digital downloadable content Square Enix launched after you complete the game!Music / Soundtrack:After playing the game, I purchased the OST from ebay. The music made for this game is phenomenal. Lolz were had when I rode the red chocobo for the first time.Overall:Just play it, you will like it. Unless you dont like chocobos or behemoths fighting for you, then fine, you win.",Recommended,

MissingNo.,43.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043776310/,"January 9, 2015",18,"Warning. This is a personal review. Everyone has their own opinions and Mine are just shown throughout this review.If you did not play the first game do not worry you are not missing out too much.HOWEVER This game is much more open compared to the significantly linear FF13. I believe that is one reason why people hated the first game.This game will use various tactics to keep you from progressing at a later point in the game which really will annoy anyone who plays this game. The puzzle challenges for example are by far the most annoying additions to this game.COULD BE LIKE ANY OTHER FF GAME WITH A BOSS BUT NO. PUZZLE CHALLENGES ARE ALL THE RAGE.Seriously, that crap made me stop playing. And sure I could go and watch someone do them, but I'd rather do it myself, especially seeing as my network connection isnt that great especially with video content.ANYWAY other than the annoyancesFor the good things so far-RESOLUTIONS: CAN CHANGE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN 720p-A lot of elements from the first game reappear, giving you some idea just how the first game went.-A LOT of crap people hated in the first game is fixed (Like, if the leader dies, it used to be game over, yeah no, thats gone now)-If you have played Tales of Symphonia 2 THIS GAME FEELS SLIGHTLY LIKE ITWell in battle that is. You will only have two playable characters, and other characters like Snow joining in, but not in the party as they are not of the same timeline.-You will also be able to collect monsters to help in battle which is cool.Oh they also troll you a bit by making the game look like an older FF tittle, (like with an actual level system) But its not.-You get all DLC from the ps3 version included too!TL:DR the game is vastly more simplified than the original, My guess is the creators saw how annoying the first game was and aimed to change it up somewhat.The bad-THERE IS NO LINUX PORT. STEAM TROLLS YOU.-Character selection and world/timeline selection can be a pain to deal with at first and for some reason to me if feels like I'm playing kingdom hearts in a way due to Noels looks, however like all games you play for hours, you will get used to it.-The AI has a mind of its own, screwing up story lines, in more than one way.--Becareful how you talk to people, the camera may be in an odd position-Grinding does help lots here, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GAME TROLLS YOU TO TAKE ON BOSSES WAY HIGHER LEVEL INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE MISSON TO MAKE IT EASIER.-Graphics options are available although limited. SE seemed to have borrowed the settings changer that was created for the first game, however I will say one thing.. >>There is no option to change the texture quality, so you WILL NEED A HIGH END PC FOR THIS GAME<<-Even though its a PS3 Port, the game has a significant performance hit even on low settings. So if you played the first game, thinking you can play the second one easily, think again.-The AUTOSAVE FEATURE WILL KILL YOU: By being stressed out, as for some reason steam needs to be not only online and active, but if steam gets disconnected, the game will LOCK UP DURING AUTOSAVE MOMENTS. Just keep that in mind if you have a faulty internet connection or you are playing during times where steam goes down for repairs.-----------------------------------------------------Over all I have nothing really bad to say about this port. This game  does however raise the question on if i shall buy the third installment of FF13 as even though the first game was mainly linear, I preferred it over this one currently. There is alot Square could do to make this game better and a lot of things that i hope do not transition to FF15 when it does arrive, assuming it comes out for PC. anywho gameplay wise It is much better to play over the original, and even though there could be a few more fixes here and there. I'm sure with the right system you would be able to play this game maxed out, however currently this game is as demanding as something like witcher 2 So keep that in mind when trying to play this game.Also for you tech heads out there, this game is multi(meaning 2) threaded.High clocked strong CPU cores are recommended. (so FX minumum, Intel core i7 or something above 4ghz)GPU Wise: RADEON HD 7870/7790 and above / NVidia GTX 750 TI and above (for 1080p gameplay)Ram isn't really an issue, so minimum being 3gb, lol.",Recommended,

The FPS is all over the place, can't reach it's target FPS at anypoint (aside from in and outside of battle using 2 different FPS targets). The ""fps hack"" helped but the game is still slowing down, the music is cracking for a second just to jump back. Same with animations. One should remind himself, that this is not Witcher 3, not The Division. It's a PS3 game that looks alright but at no point shows why it's currently killing my i5 and my Geforce 970 GTX.On the message board you read ""don't give a bad review...the game is good...or it's alright...well it doesn't suck...atleast not to that degree"".

Rossay,70.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Roseohey/,"June 2, 2023",0,"This sequel offers improvements over everything from the past game.Gameplay-wise, there's much more side content, and less tedious and not grindy at all compared to XIII. There are NPCs to talk to (even though very few and without deep dialogue options). You're not locked to anything by progressing the story, thus you can revisit all the places you've already visited whenever you want.Combat is improved with Quality of Life changes and the introduction of a monster collection mechanic acting as your third party member: you can farm monsters and ""spend"" them on other monsters to give their auto-abilities, something that people who love micro-optimization in their characters will definitely love. Though, there are some monsters you can only get once, and the game does not warn you about this. I've noticed a difficulty spike only toward the final chapter of the game, hinting at collecting more Fragments, which essentially are what you get through side content - getting all 160 of them is required to 100% the game and learn the most about it. Not all DLCs from the console version are included, but they are good, and the modding community was able to restore those not included.On the narrative side of things, this game introduces the two most important characters of the trilogy, Caius and Yeul (together with Noel), who are very well characterised and likeable characters. The characterization of Serah, the main protagonist alongside Noel, is not too good or deep. The game also presents alternate endings as side content, though they're not too important, with the exception of the secret cutscene you get by unlocking and viewing all of them.As with the first game, the presentation of information is not well managed. lots of info is dumped into the in-game Archive. There are two novels of this game, ""Final Fantasy XIII-2 Fragments Before"", meant to be read after playing Final Fantasy XIII, before XIII-2, and ""Final Fantasy XIII-2 Fragments After"", meant to be read after completing XIII-2. I found the narrative relevance of this two novels high and great compared to the novel of XIII.Graphics are good but heavily damaged compared to the original console release, with several bugs, some of which the modding community managed to fix. Soundtrack is great and dub are great.The PC port of this game is the worst of the three. It comes with big, big graphics fidelity issues, and optimization feels non existant -- this game runs the worst of all three.I do still recommend this game on PC, if you have a powerful enough machine.  Mods improve the game a lot and the modding community is amazing. If you do not possess a good enough PC, the console version is still a good option. If you play the Xbox 360 version on Series X/S you also get 4K and 60 fps, even though I do not know if it's a consistent framerate or not.",Recommended,

(Minus Serah. Her character, to me at least, is just ""Oh, look, it's Lightning's sister."")As far as sequels go, this one is good, but it wasn't really necessary.

Sophis,38.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tsophis/,"May 24, 2019",1,"Do you know how there are some games that are so, so bad, but you keep going on anyway, hating every second of it, just to see it through the end? This is one of those games. I’ve played every FF game up until XV, and this must be the one I hated the most.Here are my thoughts on this disaster of a game:It seems like they had absolutely no idea on how to progress the story after 13’s ending, so they made a filler game until they could come up with something. And it’s not an engaging and fun filler, mind you. They decided to include the overused time-travel trope in the story, out of nowhere, without any cool gimmicks. So, what happens is: you keep going back and forward between the same places on different time dimensions to complete quests and then advance the game. FF XIII’s story is not that great, I agree. However, even though the narrative could get quite confusing at times, it still made  sense. I knew more or less what I was doing and why. It still got me to the point of “ok, I’m intrigued, let’s play the following one to see what happens next”. But, on this game? Holy cow. Some random dude fell out of the sky and then told you that both of you must start travelling back in time to chase another random dude that also came out of nowhere but guess what, he’s actually responsible for the whole time-travel thing and probably for what happened to your sister as well, and you need to defeat him because…well, he’s saying all those cheesy bad guy lines, so he’s the villain, I guess. And let’s not forget a lot of retcon thrown into the mix. It really looks like bad fan-fiction.Oh, did you want to know what happened to the characters after XIII’s ending? We’ll get to that, poor thing! Forget about it for now and let’s switch the focus for 30h so we can play time-travel with Pokémon. Yeah, that’s right. It’s a mess. You only have two characters for the whole game, so there’s not a lot you can do for specializations, builds and stuff. You just have to keep levelling up and getting 200 skills from different roles, which you won’t use half of by the way, but you need them to get passive attribute increases. You don’t even have to think about it for the most part. Oh, and there are some quick-time events that you have to hit during some of the battles too! I had absolutely no fun in battles. The previous game offered much more of a challenge, while this one is just a watered-down version of it.And did I mention Pokémon? Yeah, they came up with a monster capturing system that lets you tame random monsters to be your third party member, and they have their own skills and levelling system. Sounds cool and complex, right? Yes, until you realise how poorly implemented the system is. At first, I was like “oh boy, maybe I can get some monster with some useful ability like a heal, I have to pay attention with their levelling so they develop well…”. But then I realised how bad their A.I. was to do anything besides attacking whatever enemy was in front of them. So, I just got the biggest monster I could find (a behemoth), spent their levelling points on whatever could increase attack power, and that was it for the whole game. At least the monster could have some usefulness as a dumb DPS for the group. I thought Vann was the most boring main character from the series. Up until now. The two protagonists from this game have not captivated me at all, in any sense; personality, values, goals, charisma, nothing. So, you can imagine how mind-numbing it was spending 40h with them and suffering through their cheesy dialogue. It felt like watching a really bad movie, the kind you keep watching to see if it could have some big plot-twist at the end, or if the characters would have some growth. But the big moment never came, and the characters stayed one-dimensional forever.I would not recommend this game to any FF fan. Not even to any JRPG fan in general. I would go as far as to say that, if you’ve played the previous game, skip this one entirely and go play the next one; it will make no difference other than like 2 paragraphs of actual continuation story you can read online so you don’t need to play 40h of filler for it. The third game has its own problems with its story going a different way, I’ll admit that, but it still makes more sense as a sequel than this one, while also being absolutely miles ahead in terms of fun gameplay.

After trying and failing to slog through the corridor grind fest that was FFXIII, I decided to skip about a third of the game and move on to the next one. After filling myself in about some key story details through the power of the internet, I jumped into 13-2 and was rewarded with my favourite character doing badass things, in a badass fight and it instantly gripped me.Jump forward to when we finally get to control our character in a non-cinematic environment, and I'm hit by the first stunning OST by Naoshi Mizuta (in particular, the song Run) and I was hooked.This game is old, and even the computer port is gone and done some years ago, but I would reccomend this game wholeheartedly to anyone that enjoys at least the setting and some of the characters from 13, and if you either enjoy or can stomach the ATB style of combat, this game will provide little challenge for you to experience  the (somewhat confusing but still worthwhile) story.",Recommended,

TheToad,57.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/imthetoad/,"January 15, 2018",4,"Final Fantasy XIII - Part 2-kupo!This game picks up right after the first one, however this time you don't play as Lightning, but her younger sister Serah. After the events of the first game, Lightning is missing, and everyone except for Serah seems to have forgotten all about her. One day when a meteor falls from the sky, Serah encounters Noel, a man from the future who says he has brought a message to her from Lightning. Along with the cute creature Mog they set out on a mission to find Lightning, and stop whoever is messing up the timeline, travelling to the past, the future, and even alternate timelines in order to do so.The fighting is similar to the first game. Both characters can be assigned any one of six different roles which can be used to form various paradigms (formations), and you can freely jump from one paradigm to another as many times as you like during combat.Unlike the first game however this time you only have two controllable characters. The third party slot is filled by any wild monster that you managed to capture after defeating it. Each monster has one specific role, can be upgraded by using materials, and can even gain new abilities by absorbing other monsters. While I personally preferred just having three playable characters in the party, the new monster system is decent as well once you get the hang of it.Other than that the two games are fairly similar, however here are a couple of other differences:- In the first game when your party leader died, you would lose. Now, as long as one of the two main characters stay alive, the fight goes on.- Puzzles. There are plenty of puzzles throughout the second game. There are three puzzle types in total, each ranging from easy to hard difficulty. Some of the puzzles can be a bit challenging, but they never get  hard, and I thought they were a nice bonus. You also have a couple of mini-games mixed in, like Chocobo racing and slot machines.- Weapons and accessories are much more basic this time, and there is no need to run around farming materials in order to upgrade them. You  need materials to upgrade your monsters, but it's far from as grindy as the material gathering in the first game.Now, for my main complaint about this game: It is sooo poorly optimized. Saving to the Steam Cloud will usually crash the game (so you have to turn of the Steam Cloud and save locally). Taking screenshots might crash the game, which sucks since the game looks gorgeous. Minimizing the game might crash the game. Even just walking through a door crashed my game once. In addition to the crashing, the resolution settings are broken. In order to get the game to look good on my monitor (1440p) I had to set the resolution to 4k, preferably 5k. However by doing this the game would not let me take any screenshots, and minimizing the game would cause it to crash even more frequently.I could make some other complaints, like the inclusion of Wild Artefacts, which are keys used to open time gates. The problem with that is that they are located in the most random places across several different zones. And oh yes, they are also transparent. If I hadn't looked it up online I would never have been able to find them all...Still, since I enjoyed the game a lot, and my only (main) complaint is that it's a very poor port, I definitely recommend Final Fantasy XIII-2. Just remember to play the first one first. And know that you will probably have to play the third one to know how the story really ends. And (since some people might get fooled by the picture at the top of the page) you do not get to play as Lightning in this game (unless you play the DLC).If those terms are acceptable then no need to hesitate any longer. Just buy the game.",Recommended,

TG_Judgement,81.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TGJudgement/,"May 26, 2015",4,"As you might recall, Final Fantasy XIII was pretty much reviled everywhere. As a response, Square-Enix released a sequel that promised to fix everything that was wrong with the previous game. Did it work?Yeah....sorta.The first thing that is immediately apparent with the game is that there is no longer any linearity. In fact, the game is the opposite of XIII, with both the story and game systems taking a free-form approach, allowing you to level your characters the way you want, and tackle the story chapters with quite a bit of degree of freedom, though this freedom also means there's some tedious back&forth in some sections.Speaking of story...it's still nonsensical, with a LOT of reading done through datalogs to get the gist of it,like XIII was.Liked it more than XIII, but that's mostly due to being a sucker for sci-fy plots (like time-travel), and for .Graphically, the game's a bit worse than XIII, but nothing serious that could distract you.Some places look just as great as XIII did (Academia looks pretty gorgeous). Graphical Settings are a exact carbon copy from XIII, with nothing to set both of 'em apart in that regard (patch for XIII released at the same time as this released). The performance did change though...for the worse. This game runs even worse than XIII did, on the exact same hardware.I usually don't mention audio, but Final Fantasy games in general are known to have good soundtracks, and XIII & XIII-2 are no exceptions. Special mention goes to that ridiculous chocobo metal song, it's just too silly to not like it!So, the tl,dnr: improved sequel marred yet again by performance issues. Buy it if you're a fan &/or is on sale.PS: Same regional restrictions that applied to XIII applies here.

YKMSanada,88.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ykmsanada/,"November 18, 2015",3,"TL;DR - The port is bad, the game is good.SPOILER FREE REVIEW****If you're wondering about my hours played, like FINAL FANTASY XIII, I have spent nearly 200 hours on the console version, so I can talk gameplay with a sense of where I'm coming from.If you read my last review on FINAL FANTASY XIII, I gave the game a pretty good review about it. Despite some performance issues that at least had the chance to be fixed, this PC port of FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 doesn't give you the same freedom. Let's talk about the port first - why is it bad? A lot of the game's visuals are a little subpar comapred to its console counterpart, but what really gets to me right now in my first 50 minutes in the game is the quality of the audio. The audio for everything except the soundtrack is all muffled and in poor quality, a complete downright shame which can really, really ruin the game for some. The soundtrack in FFXIII-2 is just fine though, no issues there. But I would suggest avoid playing with a headset, as hearing how muffled and poor some of the voices were done might just put you off.Now on to the game itself. When FFXIII was released, a major complaint was that it was mainly all hallways and corridors all the way up to Chapter 11, when you reached an open world area and where you would spend most of your time playing the game ultimately. In FFXIII-2, this issue is fixed, much to the delight of those giving the XIII series another chance. Straight away, in the starting area of the game, you'll get the chance to explore all the nooks and crannies of the town, really giving away the sense of exploration and detail in each individual map. The game, is always in the XIII series, looks gorgeous. From the sights of the Archlyte Steppe to Cocoon, each environment is captured with a sense of beauty and detail.Gameplay wise, the core aspect of Paradigms and Auto Battle is the same. But, if you read my review on FFXIII, you'll know what I'm going to say here. FFXIII-2's biggest flaw with gameplay can be fixed with a simple tick of a button in the options menu - the Default to Abilities. Many players went through FFXIII and FFXIII-2 using Auto Battle, complaining at how easy and boring the game was when what they were actually doing was playing the game at half it's potential. Set the option to Default to Abilties, and give yourself a challenge in this game. The Paradigm system is one of my favourite battle systems in the FINAL FANTASY franchise for a reason - give yourself the chance to play the game.Overall, the port of this game does the actual game no justice at all - FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 fixes many of the problems encountered in FINAL FANTASY XIII, and is always a worthy addition to the legendary roster of JRPGS. Unfortunately, much to my dislike, I'll have to vote aganst buying this game purely because of the poor port. Maybe in time, when Square releases a performance patch, this game will become recommended, but at the moment, it's another game ruined by poor ports.",Not Recommended,

Almost 2000 other Steam reviews will tell you all about it, and how to circumvent it, but there's more going on here.The core game is a dramatic upgrade from 13-1 in every category, except maybe for music. The character dialogue, environments, set-pieces, and story are greatly improved overall. The combat, for the most part, is quite a bit easier than in the first game, but that's mostly owing to it actually working as intended here. The monster diversity and levelling system is decent enough. The weapon and accessory selection is a little myopic, but not worse than the pointless mess in 13-1.However, gating achievements, the hidden ending, and certain fragments behind massive amounts of backtracking, guide bait Wild Artefacts, exceptionally hostile casino RNG and 100% bestiary completion badly soured the overall experience by the end of it, and unfortunately nudge this game, which I might have otherwise recommended in spite of the unacceptable port, into negative territory.Unless you're on some crazy mission to complete every Final Fantasy game, you're probably safe giving 13-2, especially this version of it, a wide miss.",Not Recommended,

If you have permanent solution, or happens to be the lucky ones, go ahead. But for safety measures, I don't recommend this broken game.UPDATE - MARCH 30TH 2020Before you try what I did to fix this below. If you're using only 1 Audio Playback AND using Realtek High Definition Audio, open your Audio Playback on Realtek Setting, try changing the Speaker Configuration to 5.1 Speaker, and changing your audio format on the Default Format tab to 24 Bits / 44100 Hz (Studio Quality). - P.S. You might need to restart your PC to apply the new changes.If my assumption is correct, the game may not be able to read the audio format differs from that.EDIT - JANUARY 5TH 2020:Funny thing is I found the solution in my case. It circles around the sound devices that were installed in my PC.I have:1. BENQ XL2411P Native speaker (not that big a deal in my problem so just ignore this)2. Speaker - Realtek High Definition Audio [RHDA] (default from PC - And I always use this)3. USB Audio device (for my microphone and additional speaker - I use this for stream / recording)Basically I just disabled everything I didn't use and still use the usual Speaker - Realtek High Definition Audio. It worked okay the first time.But, after PC restarted the next day, the freeze and crash comes back again.So, I found out that the active speakers is messing with FFXIII-2.I have USB Audio Device and Speaker - RHDA plugged in (but using the Speaker as default playback, not USB Audio Device)When the Intro started, I could hear the Music just fine through my speaker, but no character voice despite the subtitle showing on screen. But the plot twist is, the character voice was never gone, it strangely played on my USB Audio Device (I have my headphone plugged in the USB Audio Device). BUT my default device was configured only to my speaker on RHDA!Can you imagine the strange behavior?Music on Speaker, but Character Voice on my Headphone. But the default Audio Playback device is configured to the Speaker - RHDASo what I did was, I unplug my Speaker RHDA and plugged it in to my USB Audio Device, leaving my RHDA unplugged.And BAM! The game just worked flawlessly (playing the game 3 days straight with so many restart to test if this is actually work or not). Apparently the game now read the audio device is only on USB Audio Device.The reason why I plug it into my USB Audio Device is because I use it occasionally for my personal use. So I won't uninstall my USB Audio Device just to play this game.In my case, I do hope SE fix the broken Audio Programming on this game:1. Like in my case, the game became confuse because I have multiple Audio Playback Devices (like wtf?! why would it become confuse? is this some kind of a 20 Years old game when technology on programming was tricky back then?)2. The in-game music is so damn loud, I can't hear voice acting (had to use mod to either Half the Music Volume or turn it off altogether)Get your crap together SE.

Nox,82.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaoticNox/,"November 25, 2021",3,"I am going to be straight to the point, I think the game isn't bad nor is it good it's definitely not a good sequel but there are ways to enjoy it depending on what you're looking for. I personally think the ending of FF XIII felt complete and mildly satisfying so while there were possible directions a sequel could've explored that could've been interesting this is simply not it. Generally speaking the gameplay is very similar with a few quality of life improvements however the story took a nosedive by introducing time travel and while I generally enjoy the idea when it's done right in this game it's not, I would even say it's a mess for the plot. To be able to enjoy the game it's better to turn off your brain and don't try to make sense of what the game pulls out of nowhere or simply ignore as much of the story as possible and have fun with the gameplay. I certainly couldn't because I play Final Fantasy games for a good story primarily these days and while the pacing issues from the first game are somewhat alleviated the writing took a significant hit in quality. It's also important to understand that by playing this sequel you will have to play Lightning Returns afterwards to get an actual ending since this one is a cliffhanger. The other notable issue is the quality of this port that practically requires you to patch it manually thanks to the community dedicated enough to fix the mess Square Enix left on Steam with bad performance and occasional crashes. Back to the gameplay, combat is pretty much the same but now you're stuck with only 2 characters and back to the monster party member of FF X-2 but less interesting (not like it was interesting to begin with) to fill up the empty space in the group. Character progression is not gated by story progression but it's even more streamlined than before and weapons/accessories can't be upgraded like in the previous game but there are some ""crafting"" in the shop that needs specific ingredients to purchase some occasional pieces of equipment. About the linearity, the areas are more varied and open and the time travel mechanic that give a level select basically a bunch of locations at different years so with multiple paths you get a bunch of endings which are mostly bad endings but fun I guess to see different outcomes even if the actual ending is obviously the same for everyone. The thing is how time travel is made in this game is kind of boring after a while, you get there you have to solve a time paradox distorting the world, spawning monsters and whatnot but even if the situations are slightly different from one place to another it gets repetitive eventually. The most notable positive change outside of linearity and some side content would be how they finally realised an animation for switching paradigm was a bad idea and now it's instant so you don't get randomly hit by the enemy sometimes. I am struggling to find good things to say because there are not many without repeating some of the goods of the previous game which is pointless in my opinion it boils down to same combat, dumbed down systems and linearity is improved with more exploration and side content to be had (it's not a lot of side content but still it exists).When it comes to the story it's sort hard to say anything positive since most of it is just really weak and disappointing I guess the best part is the villain has a decent motive but his solution is laughable so aside from his good battle theme and alright personality he's forgettable. I complimented the pacing being better but the beginning of the game is still a bit of a ""what the hell is going on in this universe"" moment in which everyone but Serah forgot the ending of the previous game now they think Lightning wasn't even there. Lightning is in this weird realm fighting big sword Caius with his purple hair and Snow believing Serah isn't insane went to look for her and the rest of the characters are just.. somewhere in the world. The 2 characters, Serah and Noel are kind of bland it's not like they are bad but they are sort of generic and most of their character progression is a bit uninteresting and sometimes okay. I'm generally good at tolerating mediocre writing but I'll admit this one was a chore to finish and my price was a cliffhanger which felt annoying before I was ready to stop there but I wanted to see an actual ending to this mess. Anyways, I would advise not touching this sequel unless you're fine with mediocre writing and more of the same gameplay otherwise you're not missing much. 6/10 for me maybe I would go to 7 if it wasn't for the port quality, I don't think it's acceptable also the music is good (didn't know where to put that lol)",Not Recommended,

Story-wise, you'll enjoy it if you're into string theory and quantum mechanics (with some artistic license, obviously, but they took a page or two from actual science). Also, it's refreshing to see a female-male protagonist team that is NOT a couple and a story with a female protagonist WITHOUT love triangles (Lightning in 13-1 didn't count, given how she was the resident grimdork*).* Final Fantasy is formulaic in its team ensemble, the team always has a grimdork, and every so often, this grimdork happens to be the protagonist. In 4 it was Black/White Knight, in 8 it was Squall, and in 13 it was Lightning. Deal with it.The soundtrack is less epic this time around and more on the pop side of things with more songs than melodies but it doesn't detract from the mood, and the world building now spanning over 700 years of history is still pretty solid.Warning 1: Some of the puzzles are unnerving unless you can actually do Linear Programming, so when the dreaded clock puzzles appear, use this link: Warning 2: If you plan to go all the way and get the Hidden Ending, the whole thing becomes a ""Gamefaqs Game"" (i.e the ONLY way to make heads from tails out of it is reading a guide).All in all, it's a worthy Final Fantasy within the confines of modern-day JPRGs so, if you already have the first one, you won't regret following up (just wait for a Steam sale).

A classical 3D JRPG, Final Fantasy XIII is the worst port of any game, computer game or otherwise, I've ever seen.  The game is straight-up unplayable after the first 5-10 minutes without 3rd party patches (techpowerup's Large Address Aware patch, ntcore's 4GB RAM patch,) due to the fact that FInal Fantasy XIII's cutscenes continually wants Windows 10's portion of half a gig of RAM, even though my computer has 48GB of RAM to work with.  Krisan Thyme's patches on Patreon reportedly fixes all minor problems (I have not confirmed any of Krisan's work,) the problems being not excusable in their number, including no XBox 360 controller vibrations on PC, no Xbox button or PlayStation prompts for cutscene triggers, no surround sound, no anisotropic filtering, and the worst, ""on-disc"" alternate costumes have been disabled, however these are reportedly fixable.Multiple bosses exist to auto-kill you. It's a good thing when it happens once, like ""Chrono Trigger"" and its boss Lavos, however, I've never seen it multiple times in a single game except once, Suikoken II, and that game was awful.  Additionally, the game throws monsters at drastically different levels at you, with no fences between them, creating a harsh punishment system for refusing to go where the game tells you to go.  Seeing that the game repeatedly gives directions such as ""somewhere on this map,"" these types of mixed signals give the hallmark of a really bad game. The beginning of the game starts with ""we're continuing on from last time."" which is not a very immersive way to begin a start a story. Players who haven't played FF 13 will miss a lot here, with the entire story going over their heads. The pros include an immense amount of voice acting, on par with Xenosaga Episode I, very addictive gameplay, an easy and calming difficulty level, a new combat system that gives a nod to Final Fantasy Legends I through III (hardcore FF players will know what I'm talking about,) dungeons which give the ability to walk sideways and backwards to end the dungeon, as opposed to running down a long beach or a straight highway to finish a dungeon, the main complaint of Final Fantasy XIII. The voice acting is the same as the previous game. This game is certainly for completionists only, and I wish I could give a thumbs-sideways for this game.

We'll pass over poor porting outright, as a fair amount of that can be mitigated with community fixes. You can see the time I've played and I've done so without a crash. Having said that, be sure you follow the community guides to fix everything before attempting to play the game.As for the game itself-- interesting lore utterly buried behind loading screens, corridor areas, endless fetch quests and hidden easter egg hunts. I see the things they were trying to improve upon from its predecessor, but they failed in pretty much every respect. They could have allowed for an engaging exploration of the twin worlds of Pulse and Cocoon, an investigation into their genesis, symbiosis and ultimate destiny-- instead we got magic time gates with a complete disconnect of past, present and future. It's how you might have expect Chrono Trigger to work out if the person who wrote it was under the influence of crack cocaine: a myriad assortment of what-ifs and contradictions with essentially no relevance so far as the overall plot is concerned.The sheer amount of asset recycling is staggering-- the budget for this game was obviously quite low. Everybody looks the same. Perhaps forgivable in the 8 and 16 bit era, but certainly not beyond. Very little of the music fits what is being conveyed on screen in the slightest with a few notable exceptions. Many of the boss fights feel panicky and rushed. Most of them also require meta knowledge to be successful at. The controls are alright, but the jumping concept seems a bit tacked on-- in many places you can hop up a sheer cliff wall but if the story demands it, a piece of concrete that a child could hop over bars your further progress. One or two inconsistencies like this could be looked over, but this game does this over and over and over again. It becomes grating after a while. My biggest issue personally though is how disjointed the world seems. After all this time, I still have no idea what the geographical layout of either of these worlds looks like. It's just a magical hop from cave to cave without any real sense of where anything is located relative to anything else. This was a serious problem in the original game and was actually made worse in the sequel, hard as that may be to believe. If fetch quests and collecting are your thing, this game is for you. If you like hunting for lore in blobs of text, this game is for you. If you're somewhat of a masochist or otherwise exceptionally bored, this game is for you.

Terrible port.I liked the game on PS3, but this PC port is just heartless and milking the moneymachine as far as they could.If you want to play it, give the PS3 version a try.EDIT:!!!Solution for random crashing!!! DO THIS BEFORE YOU START YOUR FIRST RUN!The biggest issue with the game is, that there is no ""Large Address Aware"". Simple words: the game crash everytime, when it need more then 2GB worth of memory usage.This can be fixed with this tool: It's the first attachment on this post.-> Open the tool.-> Find your .exe (located here: /Steam/steamapps/common/FINAL FANTASY XIII-2/alba_data/prog/win/bin/ffxiii2img.exe ).-> Tick the box.-> Save it.-> You're done!I recommend you to disable the Steam Cloud Synchronization as well!-> Right click the game-> Go to properties-> Select the Updates tab.-> Disable SCS (the ticker on the bottom)-> Save it.Game works now smoother, but you just hit the 60 FPS in loading screens and some small locations.

While I feel it's a better game it will not win over people that hated 13-1. In fact this game is hated by a lot of people that liked FF13, so keep that in mind as well.Story: Following the events of FF13, things have begun to go very long, lightning has disappeared and the timeline is in shambles. You play as Serah, Lightning's sister, and a new character Noel. You traverse the timeline fixing anomalies known as paradoxes and attempt to repair the timeline and stop further damage from occurring. This story takes a wildly different direction than the previous game, and while it doesn't work perfect (as time travel rarely does) it's fairly passable.Gameplay:If you played FF13 you should know what to expect. Only some minor changes here and there, enemies spawning around your instead of being static in the world, making a mix of random encounters and FF13's static enemies. The game also features only 2 main playable characters, the third party slot reserved for tameable creatures. Most monsters in the game can be tamed and used in battle, each one having unique abilities, crystarium, and access to one paradigm. This system is actually pretty robust, allowing you to level many monsters and infuse them into other monsters to pass on their abilities.The game also now features a jump button which is new (Although not often that useful). While the core of the game is very similar to FF13, you will definitly find a lot of quality of life changes here and there. Although I will mention the loss of other human characters has crippled endgame choice in many aspects and the actual scope of progression is much smaller than FF13. It's a more compact game in a lot of ways, but I honestly appreciate that.Aesthetics:Top notch, amazing looking game. The game does dip in framerate under certain conditons, but these were pretty rare, for me anyway. Music is fantastic, tons of new and old tracks for the FF13 universe.tl;dr Slightly improved over FF13 in a lot of ways, but still a very similar game, stay away if you dislike FF13.",Recommended,

Seng Tsan,102.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sengtsan/,"February 18, 2017",0,"I wrote a review in 2017. I took a dump on it because it was such a bad port. 6 years later, with the benefit of a significantly better PC and the contributions of the incredible PC modding community that care enough to help improve the shoddiness of the port Square Enix gave us, I feel I can give it a tentative recommend. I am playing this with the Nova Chystalia Launcher, with a number of mods that restore DLC content, improved textures, sound quality and, most importantly, fix performance. It isn't perfect but it is a lot, lot better than what I experienced the first time around.  4k resolution, an occasionally shaky 60fps frame rate and a cleaner audio presentation make this far more enjoyable than before. Given how underutilised my GPU is this remain a horribly CPU bound performance, even on what I feel should be a more than sufficient ryzen 5600. N.B. I found that the first entry in this trilogy, another shoddy port, has been much more comprehensively fixed by mods, particularly on the performance front as a reference point. As to the game? It has plenty of flaws but I enjoyed it in any case. I have a soft spot for the franchise so I cut it perhaps more slack than most. In summary, if you can go to the trouble of modding the hell out of this then it's worth giving a go. The fixes go a long way but your CPU might still not be powerful enough to overcome the performance issues that remain unless you have a top end part.",Recommended,

The game is much less linear than the previous game, you get a choice of where you would like to go during the game, there is no completely set path and you can wander off doing something different than the main story if you felt like it. There is alot of side stuff with 160 fragments to collect and the DLC includes two story scenarios and multiple coliseum battles that adds more for you to do in the game.The story is great, the whole time travelling idea can be rather confusing at first but it clears up towards the middle/end of the game. The ending is amazing to me The characters are good, I love Serah but I think Noel can be kinda annoying sometimes, it's not that hard to deal with him though. This game introduces a new version of the Crystarium system and you can choose the stats that you gain through levelling different roles as you go through the crystarium ranks. For an optimal build you can find them online, and on the guides here on steam that are uploaded by people, but I didn't follow any and went my own way.One thing I don't like too much is the casino games in Serendipity. You are required to earn a certain amount in the slot machines to receive one fragment and that can take such a long time, it's really hard to have a huge gain of coins, I've tried so much and haven't managed to get the right amount yet. Chocobo Racing is fun, and the Sazh DLC game Chronobind is a good way of earning coins if you understand it.I feel like the amount of stuff to do in the game is worth the price, and is very much a steal in a sale.10/10",Recommended,

Lotus,19.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamylotus/,"July 9, 2023",5,"is only the third (!) direct sequel in the long-running  franchise after  and . But considering how beloved  and  were and how  was, it’s also the only direct sequel in the franchise that really had to improve upon what came before. And despite a short development time of only  (!),  actually managed to (partially) fix what many disliked about its predecessor, miraculously.First of,  doesn’t fix what isn’t broken: The (great) ATB battle system from  makes a return, which means that stagger bars, paradigm shifts and the Crystarium are back again. There have been some adjustments however, as  drew criticism for only opening up its battle system late into the game. Now most jobs are available from the beginning and as core abilities are unlocked quickly, character development and stats can be influenced by the player from the start.Another change concerns the party system: As  only features two protagonists, there’s a third character slot that needs to be filled during battle. This can be done by taming certain enemies after fighting them in the wild. This might sound like  but in praxis it’s even more simple than that: A monster (only one per species) might join your party after battle, which is simply based on chance. And while monsters can be levelled by infusing them with certain items, their job as well as their (passive & active) abilities are predetermined. Only their stats as well as their looks can be (slightly) influenced by the player.But even if the monster system is somewhat simple, it allows for easy and quick party customization. Want your protagonists to focus on certain jobs in the beginning? Simply swap in a fitting monster for the jobs you might only want to level later. All monsters also got special “empathy” abilities which can be triggered after a certain time, which can range from attack with decent manage to very useful party-wide heals. The only downside to the monster system might be the additional time investments to gather the right materials in order to fully boost them to their max level.Another common complaint about  concerns linearity, as there were many straight corridors and very few open areas to explore. This has also been addressed by , which consists of many open areas, although most of them are on the smaller side. Think , though the similarities don’t end there: In both games, areas can only be accessed by selecting them from a map in a central hub, which means the world doesn’t feel as connected/coherent as the ones in  or  for example. also offers less interesting locations compared to  but is about the same visual quality otherwise – which is hardly surprising since many assets are reused. The soundtrack is quite varied this time around, which might fit the difference of the individual locations but doesn’t really seem coherent in the bigger picture. Additionally, there are a few moments where the music choice feels ill-fitting, which is extremely rare for a  title.As with , the PC port of  is of very poor quality again. This does include console-exclusive DLC this time around, visit  for fan-made fixes if you really want to play this game one day. The focus of the remaining review concerns the central theme of : time travelling. In terms of gameplay, it’s mainly used to restrict the available locations. Want to access a certain timeline for the next story segments? Find the right items (artifacts) to do so. Want to gather all available collectibles (fragments)? Manipulate the time of certain locations via artifacts. Though a time travel element during battles/exploration would’ve been interesting, time travel is only used to alter entire locations (e.g.: visit the same place 200 years in the future).The real problem of introducing time-travel and the main problem of  as a whole is the influence time-travelling has on the story. Time-travel stories are very hard to pull off and can quickly turn into a narrative mess, as the audience needs to be properly guided through a labyrinth of similar-but-different timelines. Since time travel could potentially change about every action, character or location in the story, it’s very important to make sure that the audience can follow what you’re trying to tell them.Needless to say that  doesn’t manage to do that.  already struggled with its  mythos and storytelling, adding time-travelling to the mix would certainly not help to clear things up. For one thing, while  does requires (lore) knowledge of its predecessor, it also feels strangely disconnected, as it’s focusing on entirely different aspects and foes of the world. While the cast of the original game returns in very limited capacity – expect for previous protagonist Lightning – the story mostly focuses on the sister of Lightning, Serah, as well as the last human of future earth, Noel. Thanks to elements that weren’t even hinted at during the previous game, Serah and Noel need to time-travel in order to achieve a certain “proper” timeline while going against a new – one-dimensional and uninteresting – villain.The resulting story is simply a mess, which is not very surprising but not exactly what I hoped for either. Serah and Noel are a step-up from the protagonists of , but they’re not going to leave a lasting impression either - and considering there are only very few characters present in the story, that's saying something. It’s also quite easy to get lost in what happens in which timeline and why, especially if you’re taking longer breaks between game sessions. The basic story might be downright predictable but it’s the poorly-explained surrounding elements, including the time-travelling itself, that can cause confusion. Some side stories with important information (once sold as DLC on console) are also only unlocked once the story has been completed.It also has to be mentioned that, once again, many important lore bits are hidden in datalog text entries. They’re even worse to unlock this time around, however, as you're required to find the corresponding fragments hidden in the game world if you want to read them (there are 160 (!) of them, all of which are required for the secret ending).Finally, it doesn’t help that the uneven story of  ends on an unsatisfying cliffhanger and a literal “to be continued screen”. Even as the middle part of a trilogy - this cliffhanger comes off so abruptly forced, it really makes you wonder why you even bothered playing through the story of  to begin with. It’s gameplay might be fine but the messy story turns  into a game that’s only for really devoted fans of  who still want more.",Not Recommended,

Strange choices were made for FFXIII-2...  and given how unpopular the opinions I heard of XIII were over here, I'm kinda surprised it got a sequel in the first place. I didn't like this one.  It was a close thing.  The gameplay was mostly fine.  It was just let down by the story elements.Arguably it is necessary for the trilogy as a whole... since things happen... but... well... I get a bit bothered when fiction starts playing around with vast spans of time a bit too casually without really exploring the necessary consequences of bouncing back and forth hundreds of years.  Not to go into too much detail... but the plot of FFXIII-2 is a complete mess.  There are holes EVERYWHERE that never get even close to patched.  The whole thing is a sequence of bad choices and... honestly... the entire game is a waste. I suppose this is a bit spoily to mention, but the main characters completely fail to achieve anything throughout the course of their journey.  It really was a complete waste of time... to the extent that it being such is actually lampshaded in the 3rd game. Things change, but they're all achieved by the antagonists.  And would be so without any need for any playable characters doing anything. You could spend the entire game just sitting around staring at trees and going nowhere and the outcome would ultimately be the same. Still...  you do actually need to know what happened between XIII and LR to make sense of the latter, so I suppose there is that. Oh, and some of the music in this game was neat.

Don't get me wrong, the game is an improvement from the last one, it is somewhat less linear than the last but it has to do about time travelling and that is the worse offense in making places look new, all the places you go to will look the same but in a different atmosphere because you revisit places in different time zones. Game progression is too easy I managed to get both of the main characters to level 99 with all their paradigm roles unlocked so the fights are still easy, what is good though is that enemies are no longer damage sponges but maybe that's because I am max level too early.Overall: it's an improvement, still bad but better, the only thing that kept me playing this excuse of a final fantasy is the music.",Not Recommended,

Pudz,47.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/doultonjj/,"March 6, 2015",1,"Before I started playing this game, I read all about the negative reviews, about how the battle system was terrible, that the storyline was not very well thought out, so on and so forth. This was my first ever Final Fantasy game, and I was thinking that it may have been a bad idea to buy this. Before I say anything else, I must say that this game is a love it or hate it kinda thing.So when I first started the game, I was rather confused by what the controls were, and how the game worked. Of course, it was my fault as I did not bother reading the instructions or tutorial that the game offered or provided. Nevertheless, after about an hour of playing (during which I was pretty much still in the first area that you start in), I got the hang of it. The battle mechanics and the various paradigms that you could switch to were more clear to me now.From that point on, it was smooth sailing, up until I first enccountered the main antagonist. I was hopelessly stuck at that portion, then I realised that this, being a RPG game, meant that grinding would be necessary. And grind I did. and FYI, it worked (eventually).A good point about this game is that even after you have defeated the final boss and completed the main storyline, which iin my case took about 40 hours, there are still things and people out there that will giive you a good thrashing. Even certain monsters that you may have defeated before countless times may take you down if you get a bit too complacent.Overall, I would rate the experience a 8.5/10, and greatly recommend it to others. Now, I'm just waiting for the next sequel to come out on Steam, at which point I'd likely pay the full price without waiting for a sale on Steam.",Recommended,

Rezon,30.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rezon6/,"December 21, 2014",2,"It's time!I can't say I expected much after the dissapointment that was Final Fantasy XIII.But I ended up enjoying this game a lot more than the original.If you want to read my review for the original XIII : Time for pros and cons:+The game is no longer a long corridor, the areas are open with things to be discovered and time travel gives a good excuse to see many diverse and interesting locations. There is a nice amount of different locations and some areas are the same location but in a different time period.+Good music overall and some tracks are superb. Like these:  +The narrative is very focused compared to the muddled mess in the original. This is mostly thanks to there only being a handful of main characters.+The villian is great, you completely understand why he is doing the things he does.+The combat is a lot better this time around while still feeling like the same system:     +When you changed your partys roles in the orignal game there was a animation that took you out of the battle for about 2         seconds, this might not seem like a big deal but removing this animation and just letting the battle flow like it was before does a lot to improve the pacing of fights in this game.     +If the character you are controlling dies you just take control of the other person in your party. This was lacking in the  original game and it is very nice to see them address this problem.      +You can also change what character you are controlling mid battle, a very welcome addition.+The leveling system is actually very open to customization compared to the linear mess in the original. If you want to you could go through the entire game without ever getting the ability to heal. Not that I would reccomend it but it's awesome that you can do that.+You have 2 characters that are stuck in your party and a third slot open for a monster that you have tamed. You can tame most of the monsters in the game and every monster has its own abilites and base stats. I say base stats because you could have 2 ""Behemoth"" monsters but level them up completely differently. You can also find a lot of cosmetic items for the monsters, including hats. Each monster also has a unique limit break ability.+There is loads of optional content. Through the story you will be collecting ""Fragments"" to unlock new locations and time periods. You get these items by doing side quests and just finding them in chests. When I finished the game I only had 36 out of 160. So if you want to, you could spend a lot of time with this game.+This time around they included some actual graphics options. Including resolution, MSAA up to 16x and shadow resolution.+The game CAN run at 60 fps but...+There is dual audio, I played it in english and everyone was fine except for Lightning. She has less peronality than Microsoft Sam. Good thing Lightning only has about 10 minutes of screentime in the entire game.+Weapon system is better than in the original. In the original you could upgrade your weapons meaning that if you just kept upgrading your original weapon you had no reason to ever buy a new one. And because of the effort and gil needed to upgrade a single weapon you literally had no reason to ever get a new weapon. In this one you get access to new weapons in the shop the further you progress in the game, some are just a straight up upgrade, stat wise anyway. But other weapons have special abilites stuck to them but these require some additional items aswell as gil to be bought. All in all it's a straightforward system but at least it works, unlike the original.+Game leads nicely into XIII-3.-Time travel elements are very ""It's magic I ain't got to explain ♥♥♥♥"", but then the characters waste a lot of time in cutscenes talking about how it works and it just ends up wasting time.-The combat is still very much a case of just switching your classes to match the situation and pressing the ""Auto"" button. There was only one time in the game where I actually selected commands and that was because I was against an enemy that had health regen but my character refused to cast poison with auto.-You can't control your characters in battles. This can be really annoying in a lot of different sittuations, like when you have somebody as a tank with the ability to divert enemy attention to themselves and the party just stands around really close to each other, as a result everyone gets hit regardless. This defeats the entire purpose of a system that works in a 3D space.-Story was okay at best but a lot of time was wasted on nonsensical time travel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and in the end it just came down to ""X thing is a paradox, we must kill/fix it!"". X often being just a random boss enemy in the area. The story was more interesting when it focused on the stories of Ciaus, Yuel, Serah and Noel.-The game has very unstable framerate. I never dropped under 30 though, nonetheless it can be very annoying to watch as the framerate jumps all over the place.- The game crashed at least once every 2 hours. The biggest time lost as a result was 1 hour. Regardless, this was very annoying and by doing a short google search I can see that I am not the only one with this issue.-This time around there are minigames, something lacking from the original but all of them are luck based and some are even locked behind DLC.I must admit I wasn't excpecting much out of this game but all the non-linearity and freedom came as a big surprise.With loads of optional content, much improved combat system and non-linearity in almost every aspect, this game is actually worth playing unlike the original. As long as you are fine with a combat system that is very simplistic and a story that makes little to no sense.I will likely edit this review soon if I forgot to talk about something.",Recommended,

Someone needs to tell this lady that her sister isnt a diary. she went over from ""where is my sister"" to fully talking to her as if she is her diary. her symptoms are getting worse.and still the story didnt advance alot.  plot wise nothing. 17 hours of going from one place to another while fighting enemies and watching plotless movies (thank you skip button). i think they focused on gameplay and threw the story away. another thing to cmplain about which no one mentioned. hese is a stutter in the game every 2 seconds which SEEMS to be fixed when an xbox controller is connected (weird?) .",Not Recommended,

There's a few steps you can take to stabilize your game, though. I'll include the step-by-step with links and link the original post that helped me troubleshoot just in case more assistance is needed.Guide: ^^ This guide is amazing, huge shoutout to the creator!Step-by-Step: 1) Disable Steam Cloud / Steam Overlay- This causes a LOT of crashes so disabling it should bring more playtime your way.2) Download Console Content Patch (  )- This is actually optional but it'll add content that was exclusive to consoles. I personally use it! Remember to use the command console!! Type in 1, let it do what it needs to do. Once finished, type in 2. Let that load and then you're done!3) Download FF13Fix (  )- This is ESSENTIAL if you want to stabilize your game. It's a simple fix but it will save your sanity. All you need to do is run it on the correct file and it'll give your game a new life. NOTE: if your game still crashes after these fixes, check the integrity of your files. If there are missing or corrupted files, let Steam download them again and try the fixes. It's easy to accidentally click something wrong but it's even easier to try again! I know this is a lot but it'll definitely give you the opportunity to actually enjoy the game. Good luck!",Recommended,

K_rent,97.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087883063/,"July 18, 2015",1,"FFXIII-2 got the changes that people wanted from FFXIII.  -Less linear -you can actually spec your characters while leveling them up-change leaders in the middle of a fight which means you no longer lose the fight if the leader dies.-enemies randomly appear rather than already being there-premptive strikes are a lot easier and make more sense-introduced paradigm save slotsThe only major downside was the total nerf of the Synergist role and how you applied buffs.  -Haste is no longer a castable spell but rather a bonus for getting a premptive strike, some items also apply it.  They also added aoe buffs which I guess balances it out.-The two main characters do not have any offensive buffs you can only get them from your monsters or their feral links.-removed fortisols-accessories are restricted, each one has a numeral cost.-some of the accessories got absolutely dirt nerfed.Overal I like FFXIII-2 just as much as the first.  It feels more fast paced in both the story and the gameplay.  The only thing you might have some problems with are finding some good monsters to level up in your party, especially early game.=====7/28/2023After some time and playing through the game again for the third time there are some issues I noticed.The game is very stat orientated compared to the first. What I mean by this is that in the first game your stats were generally limited by the crystarium. In FF13-2 though there is no limiting. While this can be seen as a good thing in some ways for FF13-2 it creates a situation where if you grind too much the game play becomes VERY bland. The game play is what I loved in FF13, the fights and paradigm creating and executing. Alternatively, If you don't know what you're doing and rush the story everything will seem overpowered. And you'll be forced to do side quests and grind. Which isn't the worst thing but can be frustrating.This last play through I did I tried to be optimal in leveling, accessories and getting the monsters I wanted. And I quickly became overpowered without doing many side quests or grinding. The game play at that point was just sit in relentless assault until the enemy is dead. No paradigm changes needed. The only fights to look forward to were bosses and late game enemies which were way to strong for me at the time, but serve as late game content.A lot of people love the monster system but its one of the things I don't like the most about this game. As I mention in the original review you have to have a SYN monster because the two main characters don't have offensive buffs. If you want to be optimal and have max damage output you'll also need a COM monster to make the Cerebus paradigm. Following that, you would need a RAV monster to raise the stagger gauge as fast as possible with triple RAV. So realistically, your third character in this game only has three different roles and if you want to be optimal you really have no choice in the matter. COM, RAV and SYN. The two main characters can cover all roles outside those three just fine on their own. -SEN, its more a temporary damage reduction for everyone and you dont even need to level it. -SAB, both main characters can cover all abilities in the role and swapping between leaders means you can get what ever debuff you need when you need it.-MED, finding a monster that has all the MED abilities you need and has a large health pool and magic stat is such a huge investment that its not even worth it. Again, the two main characters can cover all the abilities in MED. A MED monster is really only useful at the start of the game when the two main characters dont have access to the MED role or dont have levels in the role.Another gripe I have with the monster system is your ""third character"" has variable health in fights. Since the third character is three different monsters when you switch a monster from half health the monster coming in will have half health as well. Having a monster with a low max health is too detrimental. If a monster with a low max health comes in after another monster switches out after taking a beating there's a good chance that low max health monster is gonna die real quick. And early game when you rely on a monster for the MED role can be really frustrating since most have really low max life.That being said the game is very short and confusing story wise. I feel this game was a knee jerk reaction to the initial public thoughts of FF13 and that hurt it a lot. Instead of sticking to its guns and doing its own thing  it tried to damage control. The game is so non-linear that it gets confusing and the story can be contradicting at times depending on what path you go down. The game can still be fun but it has some issues that FF13 never had.",Recommended,

I've played and finished nearly all Final Fantasy games, and I must say Noel is one of the best characters I've seen , although he quite looks like Sora from Kingdom Hearts and also acts like him. It's a shame that Noel takes place only in this game, he could've been such a good protagonist in my opinion but back to the topic. FF XIII-2 takes place 3 years after the FF XIII and we are looking for Lightning through time and space. Yeah, that means we are time travelling, restoring future and collecting artifacts and fragments. I think the story is quite fine and interesting that we can see the what happens from time to time and how the other characters change through time. I must say, leveling and the game is easier than XIII itself. Probably you guys have seen, how hard XIII turned into during last chapters and they were like hell. But XIII-2 is not that hard I must say.  Sometimes, during cutscenes or boss-fights you can encounter a cinematic action, similar to FF VIII's cutscene interacts, which I liked a lot in this game. While fighting a boss, a QTE occurs which is also visually fun and stunning mostly, and then you need to continue your boss fight from that point. Sounds awesome, and is awesome. Soundtracks are, kinda different but interesting. Sometimes fight theme is like dubstepish, some time it has some melodies and riffs of a metal song and sometimes it's typical FF soundtrack.If you played and like XIII , XIII-2 is a must buy game for it's story and gameplay.10/10 would time travel with Serah to find my waifu Lightning.",Recommended,
Godolphin,4.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037328214/,"August 31, 2022",1,"What an awful game. Who do we even blame for this? I should make clear at the start that I think this game's predecessor () is very good, so much of my disappointment comes down to this being a bad sequel in every possible way.To start with the obvious: this port is a technical achievement. It is utterly resilient to improvements in computer hardware in the last decade and assures the same crummy performance even if you have a PC built this year (or any year after this review is published). There exist mods which fix the most serious problems (i.e. crashes) but you'll still get frame rates bouncing all over the place, cut scenes constantly hanging at random, and lots of other sandpaper for the brain.To add to that, the game is just harder to play. The preceding game had excellent keyboard (and keyboard+mouse) controls and here they're just worse. Controlling the camera with the mouse is like molasses even at the highest sensitivity so that's basically not an option anymore. A dedicated jump button was added for reasons I will never understand and it cannot be remapped. Seriously, just visualize this: WASD for movement, numpad for camera controls and... Backspace for jump. Could they have chosen anything more awkward? And none of those can be remapped! But you can bet it'll let me remap the pause button because *shrug*. (I'm guessing a gamepad works fine but you'll need a mod to get the right prompts to show.)But let's say you can tolerate this total lack of software craftsmanship. The game you're getting is just a total capitulation. It's cowardice! A big reason I enjoy  is because of the number of bold changes it made to the JRPG formula. And  just walks those all back. Did you like the streamlined maps? Well now you're back to bloated, half-baked areas that waste your time as you wander around figuring out what you need to do. What about the carefully controlled level of difficulty? Completely gone, which means this game will be way too easy for most of you. And here's other miscellaneous trash that ended up in :I could go on but it's not worth it. If you hated  then don't play this (not that you were planning to anyway).

Coreus (Old Profile),41.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/coreus-oldprofile/,"October 24, 2016",2,"First of all do yourself a big favor and turn off Cloud save syncing. The game will most likely crash often when you try to save unless it's off. The game is also locked at 30fps unless you download a fan made fix. There are definitely slowdowns during gameplay if you use this, and voices can come out of sync as a result since lip-sync is not directly tied to framerate - a horrible mistake imo.If you somehow can look past these pretty bad flaws, there's a game here that much better than FF XIII, with a soundtrack that's both great and laughingly bad. This time you're able to tame monsters which is actually great fun. There are way more side missions and optional paths this time around and you can even go choboco racing. As for the story, well it's pretty convoluted to say the least. Highly simplified one can say that: Serah, Lightning's sister in the first game got saved from her crystal stasis at the end of FF XIII. However, Lightning has somehow disappeared. Serah along with a time travelling dude named Noel Kreiss agrees to go looking for her. And they do that by travelling through time.In short, it's a mixed bag. It has interesting mechanics, a story and gameplay that's better that FF XIII, but a soundtrack that leaves some things to be desired. I'm looking at you, death metal chocobo song. However you can't look away from the horrible load times, semi-frequent crashes and bad framerate. Pick this up only if you can cope with the shortcomings - some downright unacceptable and puzzling for a pc port taken into account that FF XIII did not have any of these issues.Do I recommend FF XIII-2? Yes.Do I recommend this port? No.Rating: 4/10",Not Recommended,
Oneironaut,54.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Oneironaut/,"December 20, 2014",2,"You played FFXIII and want to know if this one is worth playing?  That depends on what you did and didn't like about XIIII'll compare the two games some to give you an idea of how the sequel changed up the formula.Linearity:XIII-2 is much more open than the first game.  Each area can be explored and has hidden objects to discover, there are also occasionally different enemy types for different parts the zones.  There are less unique locations than the first game, but I think the openness of the areas makes up for it.Party members:  There are 2.  The first game had 6 characters to choose from and while many parts forced you into specific configurations of party members, there were times that you had a choice of how to compose your party.  XIII-2 only has two human party members and the third slot is for monster party members that you capture and level up sort of like pokemon.  There is quite a bit of depth to this mechanic, but I still would have liked some extra speaking party members.Combat:  Largely unchanged.  Big improvements are the ability to continue fighting a battle when your party leader dies, and the ability to change leader mid-battle.  Some of the SAB and SYN abilities appear to be missing, making those roles a bit more simplified(Those skills may be present in monster party members that I haven't used yet)  Monsters are not sitting out of the world in this game, at least for the most part.  They act more like the random encounters of older JRPGs, with the exception that you can still occasionally avoid them after they have spawned by running away.  I feel like this is a better system because it mostly prevents you from farming a single enemy over and over like the optimal CP grind in the first game which ultimately led to me giving up on its endgame. Crafting:  I disliked the crafting system in the previous game, largely because it wouldn't tell you which items were required to improve weapons, and it had no indicator to show when a piece of equipment was at it's max level or could be upgrading another rank.  XIII-2 has solved these problems but also has a much simpler system which lost some of the depth that could have been.  A vendor sells you new weapons in exchange for crafting materials and occasionally an old weapon too.  Story:I found FFXIII's story to be enjoyable but also easily forgettable.  I didn't think any of the characters were well written or very likable(except for maybe Saszh) and only a few months later I barely remember any of the major plotpoints.  XIII-2 is much the same case, There are parts of the story that I liked, but the character dialogue was mostly bland and often grating.  In particular I found one of the main characters very unlikable, and with no option to remove him from my party I had to play the entire game with him.Endgame:  I find that I am enjoying XIII-2's end game much more than that of the previous game.  The path to max level is almost over and I have just been going around doing quests for fragments with barely any true grinding. There is a lot to do with the monster party members that I have not done yet; that appears like it could get grindy later on.  I haven't fought any of the hardest bosses in either game yet, but for XIII-2 I do think I will end up doing that, while I don't know if I can stand the grind in XIII long enough to get there.New Things:Puzzles:  There are some puzzles that are required to be completed in certain areas, and for the most part I found these ranged for boring and unenjoyable to frustrating and unenjoyable.  I think at this point that I've finished all of the puzzles in the game, and I didn't find one of them to be enjoyable at all, and I enjoy playing puzzle games occasionally.Hidden objects:  There are a lot of hidden objects to find in the game for 100% completion.  Fragments are mostly tied to quests but occasionally hidden throughout the game world.  There is an indicator to show you how many you are missing in a particular area, and I've been enjoying hunting these down.  I find them much more interesting than the less varied Ci'eth stone missions from the first game.Then there are the wild artefacts which I ended up hating.  These are hidden objects that must be found to access certain areas.  Most of them I found during regular play, but after beating the game I still had a few that I hadn't found, and with no indicator hinting at which zone they might be in, I had to mindlessly comb every area I had been to looking for the last few.  I finally did manage to find them all, but I found the task very frustrating.  It feels like the developers might have been assuming that players would just go online for a guide for these, but I prefer to avoid outside assistance when possible.Overall I enjoy it and if you enjoyed the first game you may very well enjoy this one as well.  It still has many of the flaws that drove away hardcore Final Fantasy fans, but some of those were fixed.",Recommended,
Tim,7.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/notentirelythere/,"March 27, 2021",3,"So, this game isn't awful, but I felt like I wasted my time by the end. It undoes FFXIII's ending and introduces an entity from a minor Datalog entry as the driving force of the game's plot. The story pales in comparison to pretty much any other RPG that shares its themes of fate, death, and time... including many within the Final Fantasy series.The questing and combat would be more fun if the game didn't perform so terribly. Even then, it's all busywork. The quests aren't very creative, usually. Buffs, debuffs, and tanking are all de-emphasized, and the majority of fights are super easy. I'd say this game's combat pales in comparison to FFXIII's unless you're planning to do postgame content.If you're a Final Fantasy devotee and you liked FFXIII, I can recommend this, but get it on sale, and don't set your hopes too high.",Not Recommended,

Sequences shift from blindingly rapid narrative advancement to coming to a near standstill. -Performance issues can become frustrating.

If you were to begin with any other installment, it would not matter because each one is different. Now on to the actual review. The game and graphics are great and introduces some fun new mechanics to the mix. A few things to watch out for though are the random crashes. The crashes seem to occur due to the ram memory limitation although there are a few guides that can help you get past it. Quick note, after defeating bosses and going to portal to a new location it is a good idea to save the game because when you’re in the historia crux, that is when it is likely to crash, well that’s how it is for me anyway.Despite the random crashes I still recommend this game due to the graphic and storyline.

While I do think that Final Fantasy XIII was better, this one is not a bad sequel. The story was interesting, and the game was in depth. I do think some things took it down in my eyes severly, however I did not run into many performance or graphical issues. All the negative reviews here based on performance made me hesitate to buy this game for years. After finishing the game I do not get the gripes.Pros:- Interesting story and continuation of the first FFXIII- Music was beautiful, though about half of it was taken from the original FFXIII.- Art was beautiful, though many of the monsters and their are also seemed taken straight from FFXIII- Monster taming was interesting, but to me that was a mixed bag.- Being able to visit other places and other times was also interesting.Cons:- Reusing some of the Music and Graphics seemed excessive. Most of the monsters were common in Final Fantasy XIII. This however did not apply to the world graphics for the most part.- There are MINOR performance issues I had the game crash once, but it was no big deal for me. At some points the game had minor stuttering.- There are a lot of puzzles in the game, some of them (the clock ones) are so hard you have to look up online for help literally. I am not against puzzles in games but those were rediculous.- The story seems in some ways to contrast with the original FFXIII and some things that happen are left unexplained (like how Dajh and Zhaz are alive 500 years after the first game's events.)- You only have 2 characters in the game and one monster at a time (three in a party but only one out at a time.) It is not as bad as it sounds but it makes the game feel more generic.- Most of the characters from the original are not in the game other than short cameos.- The game does have some minor graphical issues, the rain in the game looks a little funny.- The fragments you have to find are often very hard to find without assistance. Many fragments are not necessary to beat the game, but some of the hard to find ones are.- Synergy abilites feel like they have little worth, as they do not last long and the bosses are fairly easy to beat. I beat the game on the last bosses and they were rediculously easy. (I think I only had to start a boss battle over like 2 times, the puzzles and finding fragments were harder than the bosses.)With so many cons it may seem like I really hated the game but it was a decent game... Some of them are minor... I loved the Music even though some of it was remixes of the original. The original was one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.

ZenZone1,1.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064388679/,"July 5, 2019",2,"Not a single crash so far in the first hour. Seems to have more stable fps than XIII but there are still stuttering and wild swings in the fps just not as often as XIII. This is just my perception though so i could be wrong as there is no in-game benchmark. Right from the start you're not confined to linear corridor as as in XIII so it's better. Also the battle mechanics is more complex as soon as you start the tutorial because you have more or longer action points (can't remember what's the actual term) that stretches the whole width of the screen.Another difference is the cutscenes and actual gameplay are more integrated. Meaning they blend smoothly; it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends. No longer is it just the standard mashing of auto-battle or spamming the same keys over & over again. At some stage you have to press keys according to on-screen prompts and it can be quite unpredictable. I found myself waiting for the prompts rather than watching the scene unfold. In addition the auto-battle is more useful now; it also select healing spells when you're hurt about 50% instead of you having to manually use a potion. Battle mechanics is more tactical now with the addition of Paradigm shift (again i can't remember exactly what terms are used). Essentially this is a selection of team tactics you can choose in mid fight. For example, concentrating team fire on a single target or attacking each target separately.There is also more interaction in narrative or dialog. Previously conversation is all automatic and so is jumping over obstacles. Here your decisions shape the story and you have to manually jump over things. Also you can save almost at any time. So there are a lot of improvements over XIII.I thought Milestone is lazy for making simple launchers year after year with the exact same basic graphical options. FFXIII & FFXIII-2 have the exact same launcher that is even more basic with only 3 options; screen resolution with option to choose full screen or windowed, Anti-Aliasing and shadow resolution. Windowed only has 2 res to choose from. There's not even an option to set V-Sync Off or On. I tried many combination of options in an attempt to get stable 60 fps, even overclocked RAM and CPU all to no avail; there's hardly any difference.Of course the one thing both FFXIII & FFXIII-2 have in common is the amazing cinematic cutscenes worthy of a place in movie theaters.  I can't comment on the actual game content or story as it's just been an hour as of this writing. Suffice to say there is a voice over text background story of what happened in FFXIII for those who jumped straight into FFXIII-2. The background story (prologue) made it easier to understand what was going on in FFXIII so it probably should have been in FFXIII. I didn't read all of it though as i was impatient to see if there are any performance improvements. Maybe there is something there down the line that explains the how Lightning ends up in Valhalla and why Valhalla was under attack.Ok so this game is, umm . Above average. Could be 8 or 9 if only performance is better and more consistent.",Recommended,

You'll quickly grow tired of time-hopping in order to run across a regional map to pick up one item only to do the same thing in several other timelines.

kmz76,39.3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998835516/,"March 18, 2022",2,"Final fantasy XIII-2 is an adventure game with a lot of cutscenes. While the combat is the same as in the previous game, most of the fights will be much easier, to the point that most of the times I just had to press A a few times with Relentless attack being selected as the default paradigm. Even most of the boss fights were made fairly forgiving. That doesn’t mean there are not some hard battles, but they generally happen in the side content and not in the main gamepath.Just as in FFXIII you control only the party leader, the other two members will act autonomously according to their role. This time there is only a cast of 2 main characters, Serah and Noel. During most of the game you can set freely who is the party leader, so you can have either a female or a male character leading the party around. Instead of a supporting staff, there will be monsters fighting along these two. These monsters are captured randomly during fights, and can be leveled up with the right type of materials. Also they can be infused into each other, gaining the passive abilities and a level based number of class specific abilities. Eventually I just used the Early peaker types of monsters to get access to high health, and infusing the missing skills from other partially leveled monsters. The fighting styles are bundled into paradigms, where you can set up only up to six to switch between. The available paradigms are further limited by the fact that only 3 monster types can be used, out of 6 possible role types. The only really important monster roles are the sentinel for tanking and ravager for chain bonus building. Till the midgame a medic was handy, but eventually the main cast will level up as makeshift medics too. The only other monster that I used was a commando, meaning that I skipped on the saboteurs and synergists. I leveled up such monsters, but because only 3 monsters can be used in a setup, I stuck to RAV, SEN, MED, eventually replacing the MED with a COM.Leveling the main characters is extremely straightforward. You select a role, and linearly progress along it. The still unlockable skills are listed at the lower right, with the level when they unlock. By the end of the game, I had the main skill at the max level 99 (happened around the third of the game), and practically all the other roles had all of their available abilities unlocked. There is an easy mode in the game, but I didn’t feel the need to switch to it at any time. That meant that the final boss battle lasted well over half an hour, since I was defensive enough to survive/recover from partial wipes, but lacked the offensive power to do high damage in a short amount of time. It didn’t help that the supporting enemies were continuously resummoned, forcing me to kill them again and again. As far as I know, there is no hard mode.The progression through the story is extremely contorted. You have to unlock random things on different maps to progress on, however there is no guidance whatsoever as to where to go next. Nodes with still darked out gates, or with lot of fragments remaining are a good guess to explore further, but you might end at a gate that requires a random fragment that must be unlocked - at an unspecified place / side quest. Even when I knew what to search for on the internet, finding out the correct route was a matter of lucking out on the search results. Of all the games that I have played this had the most obtuse online guidance help. If you don’t follow a full walkthrough guide right from the start (and I didn’t do that at any point), expect a lot of hindrances to progression. Even the side quests are not highlighted in any way, you literally have to talk to everyone, hoping to start a side quest instead of getting a random bit of trivia. When you do get a side quest, there will be a hint image showing the completion location. If that image seems entirely unfamiliar, it means that it is in a place you haven’t traveled yet (and of course with no help whatsoever how to get there).Some maps can be accessed through a special key item - the wild artifact. As far as I can tell, all of those maps are optional, you can reach the ending without touching them. You get at least one of these artifacts for free on the map, I got one as a side-quest reward and as a last resort they can be bought for coins in the casino - and since money can be freely traded for coins, at worst you can buy such a wild artifact for 100.000 gil. Don’t expect to have the map fully unlocked just by playing through the main game path. Beside the wild artifact maps, there will be some paradox ending maps, which I assume can be accessed after finishing the main story line. As such having a lot of undiscovered nodes on the map is normal for a simple playthrough through the main storyline.Most of the times you will encounter enemies through them randomly spawning out of thin air on you in the map. I remember only one map with roaming enemies, but even there were enemies randomly spawning. There is an option of running away from random spawns, but that works only if there is enough space to distance yourself from them, and they don’t have fast units (generally there will be no such units). Also there is a bonus if you can engage an enemy by pressing A, instead of being attacked by it or running accidentally into it (which is very easy as they spawn out of thin air as you run, and in confined spaces its almost guaranteed that you run into them). Should you fail an encounter, after the game over screen you get a retry option, starting just before the encounter. I didn’t know for a long time, but the save button can be used to force a retry even before the actual defeat.There are a variety of logical puzzles to solve, but one kind of them is quite though. It is the clock puzzle, where the problem is exacerbated by the fact that you don’t even know the right starting point, and eventually with 9+ possible starting points there can be a lot of trials that are doomed from the start. I eventually used an online solver.You can buy better equipment at the various store points sprinkled througout the game. Some of them require special components to farm. I abstained from selling random junk, because I didn’t know what would be a useful upgrade component. In a hindsight, I could have sold everything, even the money only weapons should be sufficient. Just in case, you can buy such money only weapons before the final boss fights.The graphics of the game were gorgeous, but that was partially because I used a texture mod, which pushed the graphics to the limits of the engine - it already had to keep some texture in the original state to fit into the memory limit. The music was good, but a lot of it seemed familiar from FFXIII. The japanese voice acting was good too (as always when there is a choice for native japanese voice acting, I used that). This time there wasn’t text only NPCs like in earlier games, everything will be spoken out.There is manual save in the game, and out of combat / cut-scenes you can save freely. As far as I know there is no auto save, so always save manually before exiting the game. Also I used only a single save slot, though there might be more.The game can be played with keyboard + mouse or with a gamepad. I, naturally, used a gamepad, the native system intended for the game. Ironically, you can exit the game only with the keyboard (either Esc + Enter or Alt-F4), as there is no such menu option.The game starts with keyboard prompts, even if you use a controller. Be sure to change to controller prompts prior to New game, as during the intro part I couldn’t figure out how to change that, and got keyboard prompts for quick time events even playing with a controller. I installed the HD texture mod from Nexusmods, and FF13Fix, which I think is a must for 1440p mode. The game crashed only once, in Academia 4XXAF, which is the graphically most taxing level, with a lot of independent actors.",Recommended,

The game is pretty good; I honestly liked FF-13 more, but 13-2 wasn't bad. The story was alright, it was confusing at first but it all makes sense by the end. Although, I didn't really feel anything by the end, whereas at the end of FF-13, I felt a tiny bit emotional. It felt like they made a huge game and spilt it into two parts; the second being Lighting Returns. So, I was like ""meh, that's it?"" at the end.  Graphics are great, nothing really to say about it. The music was perfect as it usually is with a Square Enix game. Gameplay was good, but I still don't get why I have to grind, even for a tiny bit, in a single player game. I couldn't be bothered leveling my party past stage 14 and I didn't need to because I beat the final boss with ease. I still had a few side missions to do to get more fragments, but I couldn't be bothered since it has no effect on the story what so ever.

Faith,19.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FaithXIII/,"December 11, 2014",16,"What will you expect from Final Fantasy XIII-2? (Strongly recommend to play through the previous game, CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM XIII)(TL,DR: Read Pros&Cons and Overall at the bottom, I played on the console version)„Why does mankind defy its fate?”The game takes place three years after the events of Final Fantasy XIII, and depicts the story of Serah Farron's journey across time and space to prevent the end of the world while searching for her missing sister, Lightning.Pros: - Fantastic atmosphere - The battle system expanded (you can catch monsters and they fight with you as third party member)- Epic music (more vocals and remixed versions for pre-battle)- ’More openworld’ than the XIII had, side missions, puzzles, casino etc.- Returning characters and places (You can visit the areas in other timelines, these areas change in appearance)- You can replay the chapters/missions anytime you want, and you can continue your journey (this is the NewGame+)- Paradox (or alternate) endings- Epic final boss battle with one of the best FF antagonist- You will get all the DLCs (3 story, all Coliseum battles, outfits)- Still an amazing story, but...Cons:- ...again linear and complicated (time travelling)- Only two playable characters (the DLCs grant you to play with Sazh, and Lightning in their own story)- Too easy- Shorter than XIIIStory (AF timeline means After the Fall of Cocoon):After the events of XIII, Lightning gets caught by a paradoxon and taken to Valhalla, the realm of death. While everybody thinks Lightning is dead, Serah is confident that her sister is alive. Lightning will be a knight of goddess Etro, and her task to save the future from Caius Ballad, who wants to destroy the time, he is Yeul's immortal Guardian and seeks to end the suffering she sustains by being endlessly reincarnated by killing the goddess Etro. Noel Kreiss comes from the Dying World at 700 AF, where he is the last surviving human in a world that faced destruction 200 years after the Crystal Pillar’s fall and Lightning ask him to find Serah and help her reach Valhalla. In New Bodhum (on Gran Pulse) at 3 AF Noel coming to find Serah. The two encounters in an epic journey through time and space to solve the paradoxons and save the world and Lightning. What about with the original team? Fang and Vanille are still in the Crystal Pillar, Hope is now 24 years old and the leader of the Academy (the new capital city), Sazh and Dajh have mysteriously gone missing, Snow left to search for Lightning two years after her disappearance, and Serah stayed with the NORA at New Bodhum.Battle:The battle system returns from XIII, you are able to switch the party leader during battle, the third party member will be a monster that will fight along with you with their own role (One monster = One role) and you can upgrade them (new abilites, better stats). It’s okay because three monsters can be held at a time, and automatically switch to the role a player shifts to in the paradigm. The Crystarium system returns too, with levels not with tiers. A new form of damage, called Wound Damage, lowers a target's member's max HP during battle and can only be healed by items, giving further incentive to defeat enemies as quickly as possible. If the current party leader is KO'd, the party leader is automatically switched to the other human character. The defeat of the human characters in the party results in a game over.Playtime (My first walkhthrough): Story: 32 hours (ofc with cutscenes)100%, All achievements, all (160) fragments, best chocobo for racing: 63 hoursOverall:For me this game 10/10, if I need to compare to the other FF games then 8/10, the story not better than the XIII’s story, but the atmosphere is better and the battles are exciting, there will be people who like this game more than the previous.If you loved the first installment, you will love this one too, if you hated you will be disappointed again, don’t buy it then. That's a pity, because I think it promises adventure not to be missed, despite its flaws.If you liked the game, I can recommend the finale of the trilogy: Lightning Returns.Thanks for reading!",Recommended,

LakkinHobo,54.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lakkinhobo/,"May 14, 2020",2,"I highly recommend the game, but not this port.Without exaggeration, the game crashed more often than I voluntarily shut it down.  The save system crashes the game (and often takes Steam with it) and, even with cloud saves turned off as recommended in several threads/reviews, I experienced an average of one crash every hour while playing this game.  Three levels actually placed me in an infinite loading screen unless I switched cloud saves back on (a risky move since it usually caused a crash), and the story requires you to visit two of those levels on multiple occasions.  This does not appear to be a random glitch since the infinite loading screen happened in every instance of these three levels, regardless of era: .  To add insult to injury, the two required levels (of the three listed) glitched out and kept repeating the story events long after they were supposed to be completed.  There are two boss battles (one story and one optional) where I had to start the fight with cloud saves turned on but I had to switch to local saves immediately after the fight or else the game would crash.  If that were not enough, the weather machine located in a later level has a chance to crash the game every time it is used (story requires it to be used at least three times but side missions require it far more often) and I also experienced a small number of crashes for which I could find no cause.  The trial and error required to find out where I could go and when I could save the game resulted in over 6 hours of lost progress in the game and several more hours were wasted outside of the game rebooting everything.There are smaller concerns that can be raised about the lack of sound sliders and the very limited graphics options, but those problems don't hold a candle to the constant crashes.I will say that, while I experienced many softlocks that required reloading levels or rebooting the game, the game never glitched in such a way as to make it permanently impossible to complete the objective (and that includes all side content as well).  So, if you want to fight this game tooth and nail for every inch of progress (like I did) then I wish you the best of luck.",Not Recommended,
Echoen,5.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/echoen/,"December 12, 2014",9,"The game is 8/10 but this PC port is more like a 5/10. Out of the box on release day, this thing ran like a sloth on my ROG G750JM laptop (GTX 860M, i7-4700HQ, 16GB RAM). I had to open Nvidia control panel and manually adjust the performance settings (say INTEGRATED) before the game ran anywhere between 30-60FPS at 1080 (though it seems to be locked at 720 anyway), usually closer to 30. The graphics and even audio options are extremely limited (screen resolution, shadow resolution, aliasing, English/Japanese voice) so make sure you're at least close to the recommended specs. Once I had the settings down, the game was smooth sailing with no crashes so far but the overall experience could be more consistent. And for crying out loud, I would love to be able to adjust the background music level! That song at the beach was totally out of place when it kicked in!The game just feels natural with a controller so I plugged in my PS4's dual shock FTW. One thing that irks me is that there's a silly bug that resets QTE displays from controller buttons to keyboard keys. You'll have to change it each time you boot up the game if you plan to stick to controllers or it could get very confusing during the QTEs. Either way, you can use both control methods at the same time.As for the game itself, it's FFXIII made better in every way with a good dose of fanservicing. Oh and it's just Serah, Noel, your trusty Moogle, and a bunch of pets. If you heard bad things about this game's predecessor, well, XIII-2 more than makes up for them, at least in its systems. However, if you never played the first game, I strongly advise playing that before this because you'll sorely be lost in the story if you haven't.There are reports of the story DLCs missing but that does not take away from the main story. It should eventually get patched up since they advertised the inclusion but who knows when that'll happen? Thankfully, the bonus costume DLCs work.In spite of all that, I still recommend getting the game but with caution. In my own experience, the game is entirely playable and does not bog down. But there are some bugs and plenty of room for optimization. This release comes loaded with more things than the console versions came with and at a lower price to boot. Putting this game on your wishlist to wait for a patch isn't a bad idea though to get a fully fleshed out experience.",Recommended,

These include:1) Switching between paradigms is pretty quick and allows for quick switching to a full SEN team to reduce damage and quickly switch back within a few seconds.2) Your party leader can now be reduced to 0 health and the game DOESN'T end. This was incredibly frustrating in FFXIII.3) Enemies have less health, no more 5 minute battles for trash. The reduced amount of time spent in each battle really picks the pace up.4) Staggering enemies is no longer mandatory. A lot of enemies can be burned down by 3 COM, but there are some that will probably need to be softened up with a stagger here and there.5) The main cast is interesting (except the furball that you ""accidentally"" throw off a cliff). The villain is actually one of the better ones in the entire franchise. I even felt bad for him towards the end.6) Collecting fragments isn't too bad once you learn that the picture alongside the text indicates where you generally need to go. Also, these are completely optional. No mandatory fetch quests.7) No grinding for tiny (but necessary) upgrades.The story is absolutely nonsense and full of things that don't make sense, but it was nice to see how your actions affected the future. It reminded me of Dark Cloud 2 (in a more limited capacity). Hidden objects being pointed out by a certain fluffball made hunting for things so much less frustrating that having to wander around checking every corner. Imagine if they made a game where you have to do that and put in a time limit. It would be frustrating and awful for a first time play.The only really tedious part was the final zone and waiting for the platforms to move. That got really old, really quick.I think this would have been better as a stand alone game with a little more time in production. FFXIII had a good ending, and this wasn't needed.

However, it has the added annoyance of you running around trying to actually hit enemies before a battle in tight spaces. This ends with you attacking the air for 15 seconds before battle as you try to hit your enemy.If you play it, you won't hate it, but I can't imagine many people finishing it unless they simply have nothing else to do.It's a real shame that we can't buy this game on PC, though.

No, it's not the most serious nor the best written story but it just feels so, so much better than FFXIII. Honestly I think if this had been released instead of FFXIII (with obvious little story changes that would entail) I would have been much more pleased with the brand instead of being constantly scared that whatever they put out will be ""just like FFXIII.""The world, although still slightly linear, feels much more freeing. There are no more literal corridors with a bunch of static monsters waiting for you to approach and battle them. Being able to replay some chapters was quite interesting as well. The combat feels smooth; nothing new, just like FFXIII. Not my favorite FF combat system but still good. I like small challenges in games such as the map completion quest or the monster hunting one; so I was happy to see that there was some of that.Overall, I definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is fine playing a happy-go-lucky RPG. If you're looking for some epic story, this is not it. If you're looking for a fun 40+ hours, this is a good choice.",Recommended,

Oh and the soundtrack like all FF games was great.The characters are a mixed bag, I liked the cast of the first game better but the antagonist of this game wasn't too bad and had a decent motive. Noel seamed pointless  and probably should have been substituted with the cast of the first game. Overall the characters and story are a bit of a mess, but as it's a JRPG it is to be expected.The combat is very similar to the first game but the random encounter rate was annoying as hell, after playing the Bravely Default games any game that doesn’t let me lower the encounter rates gets on my nerves and I have to force myself to keep playing multiple times.Not as good as the first FF13 game but worth a play if your a fan of the series or JRPGs.",Recommended,

The story in this was even more headache inducing than the previous game. The battle system remained the same with the addition of catching monsters and adding them to your party to fight along side you. This could have been great. However, the low chance of you getting the monster you want to spawn, and join your party is a bit vexing but that is not all. If you want your monster to actually be worth a damn, you need to catch other monsters to fuse with it and level that SoB before it can be fused. Meaning, farming, heaps of farming will be had. If you're intending to use the cute monsters, they are worthless in battle. I tried, I eventually had to retire Cait Sith as he was just not gonna cut it. Sad. I'm on the fence about recommending this game or not. If you fancy yourself hours of grinding and some Pokemon battles, this is your game. Ignore the story though, it hurts to think about. Just look at the graphics, the scenery is lovely. This game gets a 6/10 from me. Probably should stop at FFXIII and not touch the sequels for sanity reasons. xD",Recommended,

If you liked XIII's, then it's pretty much the same with a few tweaks that make it better  such as the fact that switching paradigms is now much faster.-Comes with some of the DLC. So you get some outfits for Serah, Noel, and Mog along with some extra episodes to complete involving characters from the first game. -100%'ing the game isn't super tedious. In fact, it's actually pretty enjoyable since with every fragment comes a little bit of story. The bestiary fragment is the most tedious, but by the end of the game you should have encountered a bunch of the monsters already.-I didn't feel the need to grind too often, though that might just be because I was spending a lot of time in each area in an attempt to get the fragments and exploring the whole map.Cons:-This port isn't the best. I imagine most computers will have problems running this at a constant 60 FPS. But if you can get past that, you should be okay.-The slot machines are awful but you need to play them if you're going for 100% completion as one of the fragments comes from the slot machines. You will never get 3 ochus. Ever. (and if you do please let me know) I can't think of any other cons.

Melamiao,33.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198168687091/,"December 5, 2019",1,"As you may have seen in multiple reviews, this is a problematic port that can crash a lot. It is weird, though, as it uses the same game engine and launches from the same launcher as FF XIII. I would assume the porting process was the same across these two games. I played FF XIII for nearly 60 hours until I beat the game and it never crashed. This one, however, is totally different. This is exactly the reason XIII got a positive review but this one is mixed. This game obviously has some memory management problem, and probably the video RAM management issue, too. I first played this game with an 5th-gen i7 and integrated graphics, the same setting I played FF XIII. It crashed, like, three seconds into the game. Then I tried the 4gb patch, which slightly made it better -- the game lasted for a minute to three minutes, still not able to pass the intro part. So I shelved this game, until recently I got a new laptop with a 1070M graphic card. Believe or not, in its original form downloaded from Steam, it still crashed within three minutes. But this time, after I tried the 4gb patch again, I was able to beat the game. It still crashed twice, both in the ""Academia AF 4XX"" area, which is arguably the busiest part of the game featuring a downtown area with lots of flying vehicles and NPCs walking around. So when you get there, remember to save frequently, I didn't experience any crash elsewhere.And for the game content itself, it isn't much different from XIII. It is a beautiful game. Of course it is of the last-generation technology, but high definition and great artistic design make it still a visual treat today. The music is great, too. The gameplay, however, is not really fun. Unless you are an old-school J-RPG fan, I strongly recommend cheating to save the grinding time. I beat the game in around 30 hours thanks for that, and I regret I didn't do so when playing XIII. But this is a J-RPG so I knew what I was getting. Nothing to complain about.The biggest problem of this game is, exactly like XIII, its writing. A totally stupid storyline together with stupid conversations. The clothing design of the characters is also ugly and childish despite nicely rendered, an unfortunate tradition since FF X and X-2. Overall it is great visual and music talents wasted by writers and character designers, making the whole product full of the feel of ""chunibyo (中二病)"" -- extremely childish people trying so hard pretending to be mature and sophisticate both intellectually and emotionally. I gave up trying to understand the story probably halfway into XIII, and this didn't change to the end of XIII-2. This game, however, is more of an asset-recycle of XIII. Probably to save budget, they didn't put too many characters into it and the whole story you have only two people in your team. This makes it a better game than XIII -- less stupid people around, therefore less annoying behaviors and stupid talks. Get it on sale, make sure you have enough graphic memory, use 4gb patch, and cheat for the grinding, you can enjoy a beautiful trip, knowing you are going to beat the final boss but don't bother to understand the details.",Recommended,

Cloud Wallace (F),67.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cloudwallace1981/,"September 28, 2018",3,"NOTE: his review covers the whole trilogy, as it is basically one single story spanning over 3 games, with slightly different mechanics from chapter to chapter.TL;DR version: Game is bad. Don’t buy it, don’t rent it and wait for a very deep sale (75%+), but only if you’re a completionist of Final Fantasy games. Also the PC port quality is horrendous for 13 and 13-2. Less so for Lightning Returns.Let’s make it quick and dirty, shall we? I’m a big fan of JRPGs and of the FF series in general, and I have to say that this game is BAD. It pains me to admit it, but after playing the first 2 games and ½ of the third I had to force myself and rush to the ending of Lightning Returns, just for the sake of ticking the damn box and getting over with it. I definitely could not bother with New Game+.The most egregious fault by Square Enix was to try and shoehorn an abomination of hybrid action combat system in place of the traditional ATB-based (or turn-based) system of the previous 12 chapters. With the aggravating factor that you mostly control only 1 character at any time, while the other 2 in the party are controlled by the AI and just follow generic patterns (if they are ever present at all, see below), with frustrating results.The second and absolutely horrendous decision was to dramatically reduce the number of spells and actions that each character could theoretically execute in battle (because console controllers have only four buttons to mash, amirite guyses? Did anyone ever mention these weird things called “scrolling menus”????). Forget the classic ATTACK - MAGIC - ITEM - SUMMON - SKILL - WHATEVER list, you now have either a variation of “Mash A to Auto select skills” or “Press A for Slash, B for Fire, X for Cure, Y for Potion”. That’s it. And trust me, it is even worse in the first two games since you only choose the classes/jobs you characters are, and then the fight basically plays by itself on auto.But hey, at least FF games have epic stories with strong characters, many plot twists and memorable villains? Right? RIGHT? WRONGHere is a summary of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is this trilogy (SPOILER SAFE):The first chapter of the trilogy is definitely the worst, considering also the overly-long development time. It is a glorified tutorial at best, and the player is forced through long linear corridor map sections with absolutely no clue of what is going on, without being given even a small hint to understand the plot of the game. For hours and hours. Sometimes the player controls 1 character, sometimes a different couple, sometimes 3 completely different guys, with the only task to move from one mob group to the other, from one cutscene to the next. Oh, and there is no character advancement system whatsoever, up to at least mid-game. Because who needs it in an RPG? That's preposterous!The most insulting thing of them all? Once the corridors end and the first true “open area” is reached, when you are finally given the option to rearrange your party and properly equip it, the final mission starts and THE EFFIN’ GAME ENDS. I had to read a walkthrough guide to be sure that I did not skip most of the game by accident by entering the final dungeon prematurely (à la Chrono Trigger). Sadly, I did not make any mistake: the game was really over at that point.Take the convoluted and obscure plot of the 1st chapter, throw time travel paradoxes in, remove all the characters you barely knew from FF13, add the most annoying protagonist teen couple ever in the mix and reduce the max number of party members down to 2. And you still get a better game than FF XIII-2! Seriously, they could have done worse only if Square was so lazy to recycle most of the assets again and again from the 1st game on every map… oh wait… they actually did it! FF XIII-2 is basically just an asset flip of XIII...But hey, you can collect Pokémon in this game! Isn’t it cool?Also, the character advancement system in 13-2 (yes, Square remembered to add one since the beginning this time!) is the worst thing I have experienced in any RPG, ever. You need several external guides just to get a grasp of it, since it is THAT badly documented in-game. It would have been better if Square simply did like in the 1st chapter or forget to implement it at all.I must admit this is the most solid game of the trilogy. Or at least the most solid turd of the 3. On the positive side, this time the plot is explained to the player, somehow. The efforts put in to fix the dumpster fires that were 13 and 13-2 are pretty evident the more you progress (although several core game mechanics are still undocumented and oblivious af, which frustrates the player) but Square Enix in his almighty wisdom decided that it was a brilliant idea after the backlash of 13-2 to reduce the max number of party members even further. That’s right! In this game you can control only 1 playable character during the whole story! But you can dress her up and play Barbie Fashion Wheel! Isn’t it wonderful?And if that wasn’t enough, the whole game is on a death timer: once the 13th in-game day ends, unless you have completed the 5 main plot quests this results in an immediate GAME OVER. Even though you’ll soon learn that the time limit is absurdly lenient (I completed each quest in the game, including optional and secrets, in 7-8 days of in-game time) it is still a very bad design choice, because it puts undue urge on the player and pushes you to skip everything just to get to the objective and save time. Yes, this game basically punishes the player for exploring its own hand-crafted open world!Final note of shame for Square: in the English translation the localisation team completely butchered and removed lots of subtexts and romanticism in the dialogue between the main characters. Because why not? WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?",Not Recommended,

Jakolentu,49.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jakolentu/,"January 29, 2016",3,"Chocolina and Mog.  Possibly the only redeeming qualities of XIII-2.  Okay and maybe the music.  XIII was a full, flagship title game; XIII-2 and LR feel like they were created by a third-party using assets that were not included in the original XIII.  The developers even stated in interviews that they had enough material leftover from XIII to create another game.  Well, guess what, this is what you get; sloppy story written to fit the usable assets rather than build assets for a decent story.  Time travel can be an excellent tool in storytelling but it can also be an excuse for developers to reuse the same environment but give it a different name.  They did try to make this game seem appealing, and it would be, for, say, people who have never played a above average RPG.  While I did not run into many issues other players have reported a number of issues with the port on the community hub page.  Sadly as a whole the experience was not very memorable for me but for someone new to FF - maybe.  And cripes would it have killed them to change or even modify the model of the treasure spheres?? Pros: a) Mog & Chocolinab) You can throw mogc) You get to see all the assets that could have been in XIIId) Cinematic cutscenese) Couple of nice music tracksCons:a) Messy story (if you were expecting romance, sorry to disappoint)b) Barely any Lightningc) Few new monsters (reused the same models/animations from XIII)d) Gimmicks/time sinks in place of good storytelling (coliseum, casino, quizzes, weather changes, 100% map collection)e) Changes as a result of time travel not tied to the main story are superficial, no significance, minimal impact (you don't get to see the results of the change and quite frankly aren't given many opportunities to make change)f)  Spawn rates are far too frequent to let you just enjoy the game; you never become truly immersedg) lazy end game; at one point it literally turns into a platformer with respawn by falling into void space (FML) h) Poor character development",Not Recommended,

My latest crash occurred when fast traveling to the hub world and it cost me about and hour and half of progress.

Now sure, you might say many games have this aspect. What differentiates FF13-2 from those is that the level up system is comprised of you pressing A to gain one level... Straightforward, right?

For example, if you have cloud saves enabled (which is the default) it'll randomly crash sometimes when saving. Seriously!? I actually lost at least an hour or two of progress when this happened to me since autosaves aren't time-based but event-based, and I wasn't actively making manual saves. On top of the bugs there are performance issues just like in the first game. I would STRONGLY recommend looking up the fixes/patches available to apply online and disabling cloud saves (I only re-enabled them once I was completely done with the game so it would upload my completed saves).With that out of the way, moving on to the game content. I loved the game, story, mechanics, soundtrack, art, etc.! This entry is hands down my favorite of the trilogy (I already completed part 3 at the time of writing this review). It addresses many of the weaknesses in the first game (e.g. linearity, upgrade system) while keeping what worked (e.g. combat system). Moreover, I felt it cohesively flowed from the events that happened in the first game, and, in fact, fleshed out details surrounding endgame events from the first game that I had complained felt lacking in the first game.

Paul Siramy,80.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/paulsiramy/,"April 30, 2019",0,"Summary : good game, but sometimes tedious. You should follow a guide to ease your pain.7 years later after my initial review (see below), I decided to give another chance to this game. Since then I have upgraded my PC 2 or 3 times. To my surprise the game WAS now completely playable. Steady 60 fps (even with the original executable file). No icon problem. All the frustration was gone ! So yeah, I finally got to enjoy playing this game. To be on the safe side, I used a modded .exe of the game, one that make the game use 4 GB of RAM, instead of only 2GB, and correct some bugs along the way (and also for throwing away the bad fps frame limiter).Not a single crash during the 80 hours I spent on this game. But from time to time I had a problem when saving. Sometimes the save process was ‘infinite’, I had to kill the game. But each time it happened (maybe 6 or 7 times in total), the save HAD worked, I lost nothing.All in all, the game is good, but not for everyone I think. You have to warp between space and time, and in the order you decide, that’s not the best for telling a story, tough it’s only my opinion. There are also multiple puzzle games on occasions. I especially hate the ones with the numbers like a watch, I had to search for an online solver for the biggest difficulties. And you really need a guide if you want to 100% complete this game. I preferred FFXIII, but I had to play this 2nd entry of the trilogy. Now I’m ready for the 3rd and last of the entry : Lightning returns, and hopefully it’ll be less tedious.[Original review]A shame of a port.* Game is jumping constantly between 20 and 30 fps, despite none of the threads of my CPU, nor my GPU, is even at 50% of its maximum. Not a memory problem either.

The story is just uninteresting, the characters are annoying and cliche, the gameplay is much less interesting than it initially seems. For example, you can get most abilities in every speciality with either of your characters, and your monsters won't really bring anything unique either, apart for their fancy looks. There are options and all, but it quickly feels pointless, in the end I really couldn't care at all. Graphics are pretty, and I didn't get any technical issues, personnally.

Watercolours,76.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nowatercolours/,"December 16, 2014",3,"This is the game FF13 should have been. It's almost amazing how well Square Enix managed to improve upon FF13 while maintaining it's core principles and mechanics.Gameplay is an improved version of FF13's paradigm/ATB combat. You still have the same roles (COM, RAV, SAB, SYN, MED, SEN) and the same maximum of 3 members in your party. Except now you have the ability to get rare drops from almost everything you fight (excluding bosses) that allow you to use said monster for your 3rd party member. This really opens up that much needed flexibility, compared to FF13 where all 6 party members were essentially the same apart from their full ATB skill. Also important to note is that there's no longer a long animation for paradigm shifting, which really feels more natural and doesn't make your characters idle for a few seconds, wasting that precious time you could be using to input commands. Characters feel less clunky and slow in their animations and you get the full combat system available very early on into the story. One of the main gripes I had with FF13 was that you were forced into the slow progression into unlocking the full capabilities of the paradigm shifting system. Other than the reasonable improvements, it's still essentially FF13's combat mechanics. You still craft higher tier-weapons with monster materials, although it's less farmy compared to FF13. Accessories take a major backseat due to a limitation being placed on the amount of accessories you can hold on one character, which different accessories having different amounts of capacity they take up. Eidolons/Summons are gone, but it's not really missed since you'd barely use them in FF13 anyway. You also get Fragment Skills, which are unlocked as you go along completing the game. These have a wide range of effects from changing monster encounter rates to opening up different endings by allowing an alternative path.The world itself has been really revamped though. You can now jump (although you're often blocked with invisible walls in most places) and as a result, there's a lot more verticality in the map design. You aren't forced into a corridor driving you forward towards the story. Progression is done by visiting areas of varying sizes, some small, some very large, in different time periods. You'll often have the option of visiting a place multiple times in different time periods, but it's not repetitive due to the slightly altered designs and different npcs. FF13-2 still has that gorgeous visual quality from FF13. The level design really has an emphasis on creating the perfect atmosphere for the situation, It's amazing how well they managed to convey each time period of the same location so uniquely.The story's done much better, with excellent pacing that feels natural and not forced. You unlock new locations (and time periods of that said location) within a level and progress slowly along with the story, although the locations have barely any correlation with each other. The story itself is actually done well. Characters feel natural and likable, and the main antagonist is one of the best Final Fantasy villians in recent memory. Pacing is done well since you control where and when to go and it's fairly open. It feels more like you're just going around places solving time paradoxes and moving onto the next world, which is a really nice change from FF13's forced pacing. There's plenty of optional areas to visit during the story, and the hub (Historia Crux) allows you to visit past areas instantly without having to retrace your steps. Sonically, this is personally one of my favourites from the recent FF games. There's FF13 tracks, remixed FF13 tracks and new music that really helps set the tone of the game. There's beautiful orchestral tracks, well written vocals and context appropriate background music that help drive the atmosphere of each and every situation. Although I felt there were a bit too many vocals and it was definite far more than what's usually present in a FF game. Not that I'm complaining though, some of the vocal tracks are done perfectly. Naoshi Mizuta outdoes herself in Noel's Theme, which features hauntingly sombre vocals, with a simple piano and violin background. The song really encompasses the character Noel and his struggles, and it's used to really emphasise emotional scenes. The main battle theme, Paradigm Shift, is a fast paced track featuring a vibrant violin, a simple but strong drum beat and a bassy synth. It really suits the frantic but orderly nature of battles and it's colourful but subdued enough to help focus on the battle. Eclipse is another standout, with vocals acting as a backing to the sharp violins, frantic pianos and punchy bassline. Honestly, even if my terrible adjectives haven't convinced you, at least listen to the soundtrack. It's really good.As a PC port, it's bad. Not FF13 bad, but still pretty bad. It has graphical options for resolution, anti-aliasing and shadow resolutions but nothing else. And it's not even ingame, but within a window that acts as a launcher of sorts. The EscKey=AltF4 is still here with it's warning box that's STILL a popup box outside of the game. It's 60fps, but poorly optimised so you can expect sudden drops in certain areas. Graphically, it's stunning but with few options to tinker around with. There hasn't been any bugs I've noticed though, compared to FF13 which suffered from random crashes that forced you to save at every available opportunity. As PC ports go, Square Enix still has a long way to go.All in all, it's a good game with great visuals, an interesting time-travel based story with an optimised combat system from FF13 and a very memorable OST. Better than FF13 in every way. Easily get it if you're a fan of jRPGs, it's an excellent choice.",Recommended,

It's just that good, you can train and level up your monster and fight along with them in battles, it's extreamly fun to spend some hours on trying to catch that rare monster and add it to your team, then train it and develop it to be part of your team. Or chocobo racing for example.I've spent hours off the main road, capturing monsters, collection collectables, doing side quests, talking to the peoples there and just exploring, this game felt just so good.It was annoying at some moments that there was too much monster spawn, and some collectiables are near impossible to find without youtube help, but still this are the only flaws I found on the game (beside the bad port).My bottom line, the game is playable, but do know you not going to run it on 60 FPS, if you willing to live with it, you would still be able to enjoy it.So...

I was disappointed, cause I got around 28fps (full HD) in the first town where you play Serah for the first time. And then I've found FFX13fix (works for FFXIII-2 too) and my framerate went to 44fps in the same location, it is +16fps. With this fix the game shows me around 40+ fps all the time in full HD, it is not 60 fps but those 40fps are silky smooth! I'm happy. Oh, and I use ""Skacik pl"" launcher.Btw this game has strange affection by its graphical seetings. Lessen shadows won't improve performance (from 2048 to 512 or even 1). Checked it many times. Here is my tests (all tests are in the same location by reloading the same save file)::512:	        41-43 fps2048:      43-46 fps4096:      37 fps:0: 43-44 fps1: 42 fps2: 43-44 fps4: 42 fps8: 39 fps*:Max. performance:	48-50 fpsOptimal:			44 fpsAdaptive:			41 fps*Ofcourse sometimes those settings show identical  results in some game scenes, but in a whole ""Max. performance"" gives you better fps, because your GPU will try to give you the maximum of its capabilities.:Gameplay is good. I even opened all achievments and it was a pleasure (regardless of FFXIII), less linear.But a fat minus is... Optimization! It's null! So freaking frame drops. It kills all pluses. My specs meets requirements, but... the game gives me 5-20FPS (!). Even people with High-end PCs got fps drops.Conclusion. FFXIII-2 for PC is the laziest port ever with null optimization, which purpose is to get more money for zero work done! Easy money for SE. To mention, 3 (THREE!) months has passed since game release, and they did NOTHING to improve it! For that reason I wouldn't recommend to buy this game. Do not feed hungry lazy Square Enix.

Tatsuhoshi,65.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mishka_Precious/,"December 18, 2014",9,"There seems to be a lot of hate for this game stemming from largely unimportant technical issues versus actual game quality, so let me give my two cents as an avid gamer with a very diverse array of games and technical knowledge.Let me start off by saying that this is a console to pc port.  While this game, as all games are, have been developed on a pc, it was developed, originally, for an entirely different type of hardware, so you can't just take your pc dev source and throw that on a computer and call it a day.  While there are some technical issues, they are largely minor and unnoticeable with a few exceptions.  I'll cover all of that in detail below.Gameplay:This game uses a similar combat system to its predecessor, FFXIII, in that rather than micromanaging every move of your team, they learn from their combat experience and adjust their fighting on their own, you simply tell them what role to fill in the party by changing your party paradigms.  While this means a whole lot less button pushing and decision-making as far as battles go, it makes for a more casual gameplay experience and allows battles to be conducted in real-time.  For those of you that still want the final say in what is done how and where to what, you can select the abilities individually through the combat menus.  I don't suggest doing this on boss fights, as a note.The game is split between exploring maps, battling monsters, and dialogue.  As far as the story goes, they have a lot of interesting bits.  There IS a solid story to be told and you are fed it through a myriad of time-jumps and side quests.  You could, of course, straightline the story and be done with the game in a few hours, but you'd be missing out on a lot of the depth of the story and information.  Take the time to explore the world, do the side quests, and you will be rewarded for the experience with a rich plot that is severely downplayed in reviews.  Once Serah grows a spine and takes up sword and bow for her sister's sake, she's a certifiable badass, and, something new from the previous game, you actually have a say in the stories, deciding what she says or asks at critical points to affect the information and reactions of the npcs.The party mechanics are pretty different now.  Serah and Noel are your only real party members and you can swap between which of them leads freely.  The third party slot is filled by tamed monsters, each which has a specific role and can be evolved along the crystarium at the cost of item drops.  This mechanic is a bit odd, but not unwelcomed.  There's a lot to be said for a Behemoth mowing down your enemies along side the mains.  There are some battles where the characters from the first game assist, such as a battle alongside Snow fairly early on, but I wish there would have been some of that for some of the newer npcs, like Alyssa, who you run into repeatedly and even voices an interest in the party's actions and time travel.Controls:Don't use mouse and keyboard.  Sure, they work, and they will get you through some stuff, but they are a bit awkward and clunky.  The convenience of a controller is that all the controls for the game are easily accessible and don't require reaching across your keyboard and hitting the wrong button during a crucial moment, or simply losing track of where your fingers are on the keyboard.  I am very accustomed to keyboard/mouse controls....get a controller.  It will make your life easier and many games benefit from the ease of access of the buttons you need in your hand.Audio:I applaud Squeenix for this whole-heartedly.  For those of you who like the english voice cast (which they did do an amazing job of casting, I might add), the game offers the usual English release as seen on the consoles.  For those of you who prefer to hear the original voices, you can choose the original voice track from the Japanese version of the game.  If you know Japanese, you'll here some inconsistencies between the dialogue and the subtitles that are curious, but for the most part, both are solid and you won't miss anything one way or the other.The music for this game is very easy to listen to.  Though the battle theme is repetitive and a bit obnoxious at times, especially as frequently as you end up in battles, the rest of the soundtrack during exploration is beautiful and well done.  Rather than simply extending the soundtrack a little from the previous game, there are only a few familiar songs from XIII, and most of the music for XIII-2 is new.  Nice vocals sung in English (for the most part) help add to the story as the songs are actually relevant to the plot in their weirdly Engrish way.  I wish the soundtrack was available for this on Steam as well.Graphics:Here's the bit where things get dicey.  The game is fantastically beautiful and well-worth exploring.  That said, the game's requirements are fairly punishing on most middleweight/moderate systems.  The game runs beautifully on my desktop (3.4ghz AMD Quad-Core, 16gb RAM, Crossfired 6870s), with no measurable issues.  All those people complaining about frame rates dropping to unplayable levels are either experiencing hardware incompatibility issues or other OS-related issues (such as background processes, viruses and malware, or everyone's friend, System Idle Process) ...or are simply first-worlders with no real concept of what unplayable is and are just whining for attention and because things aren't perfect for them.  Nothing is going to be perfect and this title is no exception to that rule.  It IS playable.  My laptop struggles a bit more with the game, on the other hand, but the issues are so minor that I still have no real unplayable moments.  The game engine is built with an internal frame-skipping mechanic that mitigates lower end systems, something I don't think many people have noticed.  While the game may not be running 30frames per second, it does it's best to keep it as close to 23 as it can.  I have no complaints with this.  Even when the count drops below this, the game is still playing smoothly thanks to the frame skipping with only a little bit of lag during the visually stunning spells, like Thundaga and Ruinga.  It's running a 3.2ghz AMD Quad-Core, 8gb RAM, and HD6650 video card.In Conclusion:This game is worth the money.  At $20, its not like Squeenix is trying to milk a new market, plus we get most of the DLC at no additional cost.  The only thing that they could have thrown in to make it a better deal would have been the soundtrack.  Sure, the game may occasionally drop in performance a little bit at times, but it's never bad enough that the game can't be played and the gameplay experience is not bad.  I'm playing Final Fantasy on my computer and I'm very happy for the experience.  As a side note, I do own both games on consoles, so I am aware of how they play there.  I can't pack up my console and take it on a roadtrip like I can do with my laptop, however, and as often as I'm on the road or in a position that I CAN'T play my consoles, this is a nice and welcome option.",Recommended,

However, this really deserves a down to earth look at what's wrong here.The game itself isn't bad. In fact it's above average by what I consider a fair standard for JRPG's coming westside recently. This game is simply a port of its console predesessor. And that is what I'm calling it through this review. My PC's specs aren't high end, it's completely running on factory hardware. And I can play games such as Path of Exile and Call of Duty AW without much trouble, if any. And I'm running on 6 GB of RAM with an AMD A8 Quad-Core processor. Final Fantasy XIII ran almost PERFECTLY with very little chugging when the particles started flying.

Toshiko,163.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/koshikoshiko/,"December 14, 2014",23,"I admit that I wasn't warm to the concept of XIII-2 the first time around, and it never won me over in the end. Curiosity got the best of me, and here I find myself, playing a game I never expected to like, and never got into when I tried.The Crystarium is improved from XIII by allowing the grind-happy players to grind to their heart's content and fully develop their characters as soon as the option becomes available; no story-locked stat progression. However... It must be said that my least favorite mechanic of any RPG is the concept of random battles. I find them tedious, annoying, repetitive, and grounds to legally assault whoever decided they were worth including in the gameplay mechanic. When you can just be walking along and some random winged and clawed thing sprouts out of the ground like hopped up kudzu right in front of you with no explanation, and this is a common occurance at the rate of less than 30 seconds per incident, something is UNSPEAKABLY WRONG with your game. The only worse gameplay offense I can specifically name is QTEs, and this game has those, too. A less observant onlooker would assume I have Tourette's.The story is marginally less embarrassing than Final Fantasy X-2's, though no less thoughtless. You can talk all you like about VIII being the entry in the series that discovered recreational uses for household cleaners, but this story is the one that should have warranted an intervention. The only reason I'm happy that it didn't is because I did find enjoyment in Lightning Returns, which I will undoubtedly purchase as soon as it appears on the market, with a very small amount of self-loathing. This series is my guilty pleasure, though this game in particular is the one I will look you in the eye and say, ""I swear, this isn't mine; I don't know how it got here"".If you use the (all but necessary) community fixes, this is far and away a superior version than the console releases, but I can't recommend it to anyone who didn't already like the console releases. And if you did like the console releases... I am so sorry. Please, pick up Lost Odyssey.TL;DR - This is the best release of a hateful game, but only if you use the community fixes.

It's better than XIII in every way really. I personally didn't like the first game that much, it was too restrictive and it took forever before you had some freedom but XIII-2 gets to the point very quickly compared to the first game and doesn't bombard you with as many tutorials. I would still recommend playing the first game or watch all the cutscenes on YouTube or something because this is definitely a direct sequel and you'll be very lost in the story if you don't check out the first game. The game does come with a XIII primer to help people who didn't play XIII to catch up so there's that too.I was pretty happy to see this game coming to the PC. Unfortunately, the game has some issues. There are two main issues that IF fixed will help this port immensely. There is a TON of screen tearing and the frame rate is all over the place (the lowest I hit was 20fps). My rig has an i7-3770K, 16GB RAM and a GTX 670 FTW so it's definitely not my PC which can't run the game at a constant 60fps on its highest settings. As for graphics options, don't expect a myriad of options. This is definitely a console port so don't expect advanced options like Tesselation, PCSS, and so on. You have resolution, shadow resolution and MSAA. The game is not ugly by any means though.I will still recommend it. It's definitely the best in the XIII series, but buy with caution.

One thing they improved is the combat (no more stupid animation, when you switch your paradigms) but at the same time the enemies do not walk around in areas anymore, they will just appear out of nowhere, the problem with that is that random encounters respawn infinitely with some areas having a real high random encounter rate, which makes this change really annoying.The story is still good but a downgrade in comparison to FF13-1. They advertise the game with Lightning but you can´t play her anymore after the Prologue, which makes it really strange. But what makes this game special is the ability to time travel. You see some areas in different time periods and eras, which is kind of cool.This is where it gets complicated. Would I play this game if it would not be a FF-Game? Probably not.Would I play it, if it would be a Standalone FF-Game and not part of the Lightning Trilogy?

The good news is that it can be fixed, just search it up on the internet and it´ll pop up, it fixes it all so you can enjoy the game fully :).I personally found out the story to be delivered in a more fluent way than FF13, due to the characters in FF13 having a hard time to make sense, but in this one they seem to have improved that quite a lot.If you loved the cutscenes from FF13, oh boy, time for part 2. Although there are some performance issues and frames drop sometimes, but they are still good looking.Combat remains basically the same, although they chopped some spells and they added some other cool features.At times the timeline will get very complicated. I found myself stuck several times due to going for sidequests and being incapable of finding where to go to progress with the main story later.One last tip would be for you to save the master artifacts, they are often needed to progress with the main story, and if you run out, you´ll find yourself having to scan half of the other timelines, or giving up and following a guide.",Recommended,

FSgt. A. Switz [3rd MAR],59.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/switzd0d/,"February 12, 2017",3,"This positive review is only because I have personally enjoyed FFXII-2 even though I am not a fan of so many things in this game.Final Fantasy, at least my favorite moments in this game anyway, all come from FF1-X for me.  I have never been a fan of how they keep trying to change more and more to a action based type of strategy game.  Almost like a hybrid nowadays, however, I understand that those descisions come out of demand more than loyalty.  With that in mind, I completely disregard that aspect which I hate most out of this game.The next is the story.  Like FFXIII, it is just a very weak and confusing story.  It is almost as if the writers all got together one summer to come up with the most ""amazing plots full of twists, turns and intrigue"".  What the casual gamer is left with is yet another very confusing story line which is supposed to be the hallmark of the FF series.  Gone are the days of good vs evil.  The days in which the games arch villian makes themselves known at the very start of the game and the entire story line through the game is a build up of that final showdown.  Just like XIII, it takes a while to even know who the true enemies are in this game.  I am only 2/5th through it and I honestly have no clue who the enemy will be.  Will it be Caius and Yeoul?  Those are the likely choices.  Or could it even be Sereh and Noel who are actually upsetting times paradox?  Or is it Lightning who is stuck in some sort of confusing limbo I have no clue how she would have got there or why.The story of this FF is perhaps the worst I have ever seen.  I am doing everyhting in my power to talk to EVERY NPC, read up on EVERY story line recap and have been following guides without spoilersto try and keep knowledgable about what is going on.Could writing like that actually be described as a masterpiece?  Sure, depends on how you look at it.  May work great for movies, but I am just not a fan of it belonging to a FF game.But I CAN get passed the story.  It has a lot of story so in a way it makes up for the lack of knowing what is happening.  Half the reason I want to keep playing every day is just to unravel what is happening.  Again, sounds like a compliment, but it truley is not.  I want the old more linear FF's of the old days to return.  Not this confusing crap.  GAMEPLAY: Plays just like 13.  So if you liked the combat style or it was good enough, then don't expect any surprises.  I believe they removed summons as well.  They are mentioned from a few NPC's that are not a part of the storyline at least.7/10 MUSIC: Has enoug original music to make this yet again one of the best reasons to ever play FF.  It carries over many songs and parts of songs from 13, but I also hear a few nods to FF1, FF3 and FFX in there (but not the exact songs from them).  Still not the best music I have ever heard in a FF game, but close. 9/10STORYLINE: So confusing.  There where no hints at all at the end of FF13 that any of this would happen.  They really pulled this one out of nowhere.  It takes a few hours for the utter confusion to sink in before you grudgingly admit this is the course the story line will be for pretty much the entire game.  You understand quickly that some alter-universe is happening, but it gets very hard to wrap your head around as to why and how.  In fact, after pouring over guides, walktrhoughs and wiki's as well as 40 hrs in game, I am still not understanding those two questions.  3/10 - Worst FF storyline everGRAPHICS: Seems good for a PC port to me.  980ti and 6780 i7 (top end).  Only complaint is that they need to support ultra-wide.  No FPS or stuttering issues to report.  CONTROLS 9CONTROLLER): The D-Pad for the Steam Controller works horrible with this game.  Just moving the camera around your character takes 3-7 swipes even at full sensativity.  I'd recomend playing this on a PS3 or XBox controller instead.  6/10Overall, it IS  a fun game.  Certainly not the best, bt it's WAY better than FF12.  And TBH, since FF13's story also sucked,  I find myself enjoying this one slightly more than FF13.  Probably because I already know the charcters more.  And the side content is massive in this game.  UPDATEI have finally beaten the game and the ending was very powerful and well written.  This game immediatly goes up a few notches because of that and you finally start piecing together the overall story a lot more even though their are some pretty obvious loopholes on why the game ended like it did given in earlier parts of the game you where lead to believe something else would happen.  So just beware, you really need to push yourself through the first 30 hours of this game before the meat finally starts coming off the bones and you can start seeing the story.  Another thing I forgot to mention was the top level voice acting the game has.  It was flawless and fit every major character perfectly.  Off to Lightning Returns.

(Note: namely disabling steam cloud save for the game, aswell as adding the d3d9.dll form your Windows/System32 folder to the game directory, done)Anyway, with that off the table: the game ultimately doesn't hold up to what the first one built, the characters feel bland the story makes absolutely no sense on any level. Pretty disappointing.The gameplay, while at first glance improved, is also alot worse than before. There's more stuff to do while outside of combat, most of which doesn't significantly add to the overall experience though. The combat itself got faster, but also alot dumbed down. The saboteur and synergist classes were made entirely pointless, free skill trees were more or less removed entirely and the game has unfair difficulty spikes at certain points, since you can end up in areas you were never intended to, ultimately forcing you to grind for hours to progress at certain points.

Every 3-5 minutes, a new tutorial screen pops up to (badly) explain a new game mechanic. Nearly 6 hours into the game, this is still ongoing. Most of these mechanics have to do with capturing legally-distinct-from Pokemon and the game's awkward Time Travel related progression, to the degree that the game just becomes difficult to comprehend, or even think about, and I find myself shutting it down no sooner than I've booted it up, and moving on to other games.Final Fantasy XIII was a slow start that took time to hit its stride, but had an interesting world and just enough of a spark of wonder to grab me and keep me interested long enough to hit that stride, at which point it became a page turner I couldn't put away until it was done. This game has none of that. Five hours into Final Fantasy XIII, I wanted more, if only to answer some of my questions. Five hours into Final Fantasy XIII-2, I want NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THIS GAME.The soundtrack is pretty, but that's on Spotify for me to enjoy whenever I like; I don't NEED the game for that. The story is convoluted even by modern Final Fantasy standards, and the new characters are shallow replacements for the original party who I frankly don't care in the slightest about.FFXIII was definitely a divisive game, but there was something special to it that I loved.

Fnord,5.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/,"July 4, 2016",9,"I recently gave Final Fantasy XIII a negative review, and was told that this one fixed many of the issues that that game had, and that it would be worth at least giving a try. So I did. Or I tried. What do I mean with ""I tried?"". Well, I tried to play it, but the port makes it unplayable.I can't make a rundown of the story, the gameplay or anything like that, because I've spent less than an hour with the game. The makers of this game seem to have taken the criticism of FF XIII having a far too long ""tutorial"" section to heart, and the bits of the game I could see felt a lot less railroaded, which are both things that would have been massive improvements. It did have a really long and uninteresting quick time event section though.Keys are partially re-bindable, but there are keys you can't rebind. Hope you like moving your hand between the numpad and backspace repeatedly, because you need to use the numpad for camera controls, and backspace for certain interactions, plus quick time event commands.Sadly the game does not work. At least not for me. The first issue I had was that the first menu that popped up after I had selected new game, which asked me if I wanted to play the tutorial or not, made the game completely unresponsive. There's a known issue with gamepads causing this issue, and it was also present in FF XIII, but my gamepad was not plugged in. Turned out I had to unplug my bog standard optical mouse, and my cellphone to get the game to respond (yes having a cellphone, a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, plugged in for charging was enough to make the first menu not work).The second issue is massive stuttering. My computer exceeds the minimum system requirements by a wide margin, yet the game stutters constantly.After finally having got into the game, I noticed that whoever was responsible for the sound mixing had not done their job properly. I could not hear the dialogue due to the music being way to loud. Subtitles helped alleviate this issue, but it's still a rather big issue when you can't hear the character speak.And then the game crashed. Unceremoniously it just dumped me to the desktop with no error message.There might be a good game underneath all these technical issues, but this port is so bad that I'm unable to play the game. It's actually worse than the rather horrible port that FF XIII got.",Not Recommended,
JohnTheCrow,7.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/johnthecrow/,"September 23, 2021",2,"After the first seven hours of this game I couldn't really begin to tell you what it's about. A generic anime villain ends the world in the future so a generic anime protagonist travels back to just after the events of FF XIII to team up with a school teacher. Something like that. Combat is mostly a copy and paste from FF XIII but with a Pokemon element. Instead of a third human character you can use a monster you've defeated to act in a pre-defined role. The leveling up system is similar to FF XIII as well, but a little confusing and not as satisfying . I always feel under-leveled to the point that I ultimately decided to quit the game because the boss I was fighting was so overpowered compared to me I felt sure it was supposed to be a scripted loss. The game wants you to fight each battle a very certain way, which a lot of FF games do, but it's taken to the extreme here. If you haven't spent the last hour leveling in the exact manner needed for the upcoming boss you're screwed. I could put the game on easy mode but the story isn't interesting enough to warrant that; quitting feels like the better option.",Not Recommended,

Xerneis,111.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xerneis/,"September 30, 2016",2,"Definitely a step in the right direction from FF13, even might be worth your money, but there is still room for improvement... You're not completely free from corridors, character limitation, or no-think combat, but the game is just too short to make these things unbearable.You can rush through main story in 30 or so hours and it won't be even that difficult to do it, but you can also choose to mess around, do side quests and explore areas and timelines you won't visit in the main line. Yes, timelines, this game has time travel. You visit the same places in different years, to access different sub-locations, complete quests from the present in the past, defeat enemy in the past so he can't kill you in the future, that kind of thing.The story itself is still meh. Humanity goes extinct, so you go back in time to change that. Along the way you're also trying to reunite Serah and Lightning (wasn't that the plot of the first game?) Most of the time you have canonically no idea where to go, so you jump around timelines hoping for the best, and sure enough, eventually you get where you need to go. But you did an oopsie along the way and the whole world is being destroyed. That's the whole story.Since you can jump around time, you can jump back to a previous point in your journey too, and sometimes even make a decision that leads you to a non-canon ending. Cool addition.Combat is pretty much the same as before, but 1) you never get locked into a bad team during the story, because the team is always the same 2 people, and 2) it gets a change up in the form of monster partners. Most common enemies can be tamed and put into your party, each one has some unique abilities, and you can transfer them around to create super-killing machine. It's pretty good, though really grindy to min-max.So on its own, it's a thumbs up. BUTThe game's first moment is telling you that ending of FF13 didn't happen, and from there it spirals into chaos that is only sorted in the third game. On the other hand, if you never start this game, that ending did happen, and everyone walked off into a happy sunrise. So you have a choice. Stop at the first game, or go the distance for all three.",Recommended,

That was a great game, story was entertaining and interesting, it has good character development and a range or characters to establish connections with through the game, here is a different story.Im gonna start with Serah (stupid spelling), i never liked her character in ff13, she seemed like the demsel in distress and that is a pathetic character role. Here she starts off just like thats to quote ""Lightning help me"" while she cowers.... she changes almost instantanious into a more confident ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Blues Clues lets see what we can find here ♥♥♥♥. She is essentially Vanille from FF13.Noel is basically a male lightning with a bit better people skills, doesn't have the keep up or die attitude that lightning had at the start of FFXIII. I don't know why but they are doing the typical bs of drip feeding background information to the player has if Noel knows all the answers from the start and wants to keep them to himself to quote chapter 3, He sees this device and straight away goes how did you get that? knowing full well what it is and what it does then plays it off that he only mildly read about it and isnt that well known on the subject..... what an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now the story, this feels so tacked on to make money its not funny. Its like they had no idea where to go from 13 so they just chose the lazy option and was like TIME TRAVEL!!! yep that solves every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ issue. Because you time travel there is literally no flow to the game. You start off in your normal timeline then jump a head a little then a little more then just 200 years etc. I just doesnt seem rewarding when you finish an area and it just takes you back to a menu to pick the next time zone or a previous time zone to replay. I think sure if you missed something or want to go back to collect everything possible,  that is useful but as far as creating a flowing story it feels like a stop everytime you finish a level and its like do i want to pick this up again? I know the next mission is just gonna be go here, talk to them, kill that, collect an artifact and rinse and repeat. It just doesnt feel fun, doesnt feel like there is an actual story, or cut scenes, havn't seen many pre rendered cut scenes like FF is famous for. Now i havn't finished the game yet because im strougling to stay interested in this game.Puzzles, I believe that since they didn't have to worry about writing a proper story they could put more content into the game, being these ""Temperal Paradoxs"". Well I suppose they are more like distractions from the main story and have very little depth involved in completed them. the crystaium I find now is just a mess comapred to 13 where you had those floating crystals and then the circles around them, now you just press A (playing with a controller) and you level up your class. the lack of characters in this game and replacing your 3rd character with a monster is both creative but takes away from any possible character development you might make being that once again THERE IS NO ACTUAL STORY LINE HERE and by adding more characters to this would almost make it worse because your Moogle is basically your 3rd character and it is just Serah's weapon (makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense, typical jrpg kawaii stuff).FF13 started of straight away with action and good character development, its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kawaii ♥♥♥♥ with Serah being a pathetic character Noel being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ drip feeding the player information to prolong the NON EXSISTANT STORY and there Moogle which has almost NO pressance in 13 but is now appropriate for 13-2.the port is just god awful, im running a superclocked 970 gtx and when i ran this on 1080p 8k shading, this raining mission towards the start of the game gave me 10fps.....................................i rate this 2/10 cause FF has decent hair modelling.",Not Recommended,

Lastly there's 3 things I cannot support or get behind in any capacity and I feel it's only fair to warn you in advance1-Prepare to be broke for most of the game, ♥♥♥♥'s expensive, gil drops are low, and many of the systems incentivize you to spend what little you have on monster materials.2-The monster training is deep, time consuming, and is frustratingly ancillary to your progress (either with your characters or through the story).3-There's a monstrous difficulty spike right before the end (like literally on the last level) and past this point most things are brutally difficult requiring full builds, optimized creatures, and quality paradigms. I honestly dropped this 41 hours in because the game just wasn't rewarding anymore and the story is doing the FF thing of using the words HEART, DARKNESS, TIME, etc as much as physically possible without saying or doing anything.Now for a special note, the clock puzzle and it's designer I hope that they enjoy torment everlasting because making a game about time (how it's precious and should be prioritized) and then making this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle is flatly unforgivable. It's even randomized so that you can't look up answers, you wanna know what I found instead multiple programs online where you can plug in values one at a time and have it solve the puzzle for you... I don't know where to even begin, these puzzles are an abomination they should not exist, the randomizing shouldn't happen (because it's not worth keeping such terrible time sinks around in the first place).I've played worse (had like 2 good scenes, and the combat clicked sometimes)/10",Not Recommended,

The game play has two  major game play  elements   the battles  which you can actually do on an auto battle system .  where your sitting there pushing the  A button on your x box controller or whatever . until a quick time event where you have to  push a  series of buttons in sequence  and some areas have puzzles that you have to solve .       This game  can go on pretty much almost forever,  As you can travel back and forth between   areas  and after you get the main ending There are at least two mini games available to you if not more.   so a lot of content in this game .   However some areas the  battles get repetitive and annoying at times  showing the same  animated graphics sequences over and over again. and   some of the puzzles take a long time to solve this is not a short game .  It has really nice graphics  and good voice acting  I found the easy battle system to be an advantage  as I liked to drink while playing this and eye hand coordination was not an issue with the exception of the quick time events.  .There are also  NPC's that ask you to find various things for them and you have to go back and forth through the time line to  get them. For the most part however these are not mandatory items. For  getting the standard ending with the exception of  gravitational cores. and wild artifacts     Check your  computer system with the spec's on this this page  in the negative reviews there is a lot of people complaining that they can not run the game I had no problem with this .    Should you buy this game  I would wait for a sale though it does have a lot of content It is an older game, From other negative reviews it seems that  It was simply moved from  the old game play system  with very little to adapt it to  pc's   As I said I was lucky and had no problems with Running it..  But the thing that did bother me is there is no function for turning off the background music  In some areas particularly when I was doing puzzles I muted my computer sound system , But given these two  problems I would not pay it at  its current price of 22.49 Canadian . The partial controller support  icon  makes me also  cautious about recommending this title   at full price as well.   Good points    1  a lot of content  with a lot of available hours of game play   2 great voice acting   3 good graphics   4 easy battle system   5 at least two  mini games after  finishing main story line.  Bad points   1 can not turn off  background music   2  battle system although easy repetitive nature of battles can get annoying  3 seems not to operate on all PCs  4 partial controller support with no signs of square ENEX updating system,      Recommendation  Yes  buy it  but  wait to purchase on sale for about 4 or 5 $ ,  The three  big negatives that  made me suggest a reduced price are  1 unable to turn off background  music   2 seems not to have been given vary many technical modifications for pc  3 partial controller support icon .   4 older abandoned game square Enix  Seems not to be interested in this tittle or support for pc users.",Recommended,

godsentme,110.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006338769/,"January 30, 2023",2,"The first game of the series was perceived as being too linear, so Squeenix tried to remedy it. Instead of going from one map to another in a linear fashion, you go from one map to another, then back to the first map, but at a different time. The story progress is still set on a strict path, so when you really think about it, the game is linear, but with maps repeating themselves 2-4 times, which is brilliant if you look at it from the development side of things! From the player's perspective, it's not too bad, considering you can leave a map at any time and load another to finish up a sidequest or grind some CP for levels. As for the story, you can hate it or love it, but it's a separate matter if you can understand it. Having played through the game and done all the sidequests, I still don't know if I understood it or not. I didn't bother much with the DLC; it seemed pointless. You either play Texas hold'em as Sazh in a casino or do some 1 vs. 1 grinding with Lightning; the arena is nice if you want a real challenge.I'll briefly mention what I liked about this game: the music.Alright, now that that's out of the way, let's talk about the cons:1) Characters and dialogue - I just can't stand that every other sentence these teenagers blabber out is supposed to sound ""deep"" and perhaps they can if you're high enough. The topics the main characters dabble in are philosophy, motivational poster quotes, and moral high ground, with your usual anime tropes as filler: something about needing to protect certain individuals and defeat the villain.2) Level design - there are some really weird and archaic design choices made, all with the sole purpose of wasting your time. I'll bring up some very specific examples, like the entirety of Augusta Tower - not fun, not challenging, very annoying.The weather control device in Archylte Steppe, there are 4 weather modes that you can switch between by using 2 levers. You need to set the lever combination (up or down) for specific weather, which then triggers a 6~ second unskippable cutscene, and unless you're a speedrunner, you will not have memorized the combinations, so you try again, hope for the best, and look at the damn cutscene again. Why not simply give me a selection of the 4 weather modes, with the currently active one being a different colour? It doesn't take me out of the game, and most importantly, it doesn't waste my time.The slow giant rock critter ride in Sunleth Waterscape was okay the first couple of times, but after the third time, I despised it.The escalators in Academia 400, the ones that go in the opposite direction, so you either bunny hop through it or interact with a lever for a couple of seconds to switch directions, just why?Last map has the tetris block barges: you stand and wait on a platform ledge for the block to turn towards you, you get on the block and wait for it to turn towards the next platform, you move to that platform, and you do it again, and again, and again. The devs must've really thought the environment visuals were simply too good not to force the player to ""enjoy"" them. I think on this map you spend more time waiting than doing anything else, and that includes the encounters. And the ""best"" part about this map is that you get to redo it from the start if you want to gather all the fragments (because of the bestiary collection).3) Character progression - did you know that levelling Commando on a big crystal gives +2 bonus strength and levelling Ravager on a big crystal gives +2 bonus magic? What about the fact that if you level Synergist to an odd level (e.g., from 10 to 11) on a big crystal, you'll get bonus magic? And the best one is of course levelling Saboteur, even level on big crystal gives bonus strength and odd gives bonus magic. The maximum level for each role is 99, so if you waste too many levels of the above roles on small crystals, you'll make your characters much weaker than if you'd meticulously followed the rules, and you cannot reset the Crystarium. I personally didn't notice these rules being mentioned in the game, so you'd need to pay close attention to know this.4) Monster Breeder - The 3rd unit on your side in a battle is a monster that you capture. Not that I mind the fact that you can breed monsters to become better than either of your main characters, but you'd need to do quite a bit of research and experimentation to know how, what, and when to fuse monsters together to get the best passive abilities. Aside from fusing monsters together, the monsters have their own Crystarium, which is a bit different; they use items instead of CP, which means grinding for items. Here's an example of how to get one of the most powerful Ravagers in the game: a Blue Chocobo. First, you need to catch one, and a Blue Chocobo is a rare Pokemon, so getting it to even spawn without the Battlemania Fragment skill can take some time. Next up, you need to get lucky to actually catch it; there's another Fragment skill that can help with that, but RNG is RNG. Because it's a Ravager role, you'll want to boost its magic, which means leveling the Crystarium with mostly mana-type materials (for levels 11-40, I used potent materials, the rest all mana). You'll need to level it to at least 86, which is good because getting mana crystals is a pain, so much so that I stopped levelling the bird after level 95 since it's asking for 10 crystals per level and I can't be bothered anymore. It didn't really matter; I still beat the final boss in 2 minutes instead of the target time of 11 minutes. Got it levelled up to 86+? Great, now all you need to do is just capture 14 other monsters, a few of which are rare, one of which only 3-4 exist on a map, and you'll need two of them, so better save before battle and reload if capture fails, then close the gate and redo some story parts to get the second one. Level up these monsters as well until specific abilities become available, then infuse them in the correct order, and you're done. I understand why some people would enjoy this process, not me, though. Granted, creating the most overpowered critter isn't required to beat the game.5) The good old Japanese grind for 100% - because sometimes it's not the skill that matters, but how much time you're willing to give. Obviously, playing 100% of a game is optional, and I definitely would've hated the game less if I had not decided to go for it, but here we are. It's mostly about Fragments, and you'll actually want quite a lot of them to unlock certain Fragment skills. I'll just mention a few good examples of the grind. Captain Cryptic quiz in Academia 4xx, getting a question wrong will make him disappear and reappear in one of the 12 possible locations, so you'll need to search around this annoying map. Once you get all the questions correct, you'll get a Fragment, and now you get to do it four more times! I think nobody would find this fun, but this is the way of the Japanese grind. The Monster Professor fragment, which requires you to completely fill out the bestiary, will require you to have finished the game and gotten most of the Paradox endings to finally complete it; needless to say, it was the last one I completed. What's so bad about filling the bestiary? For example, did you know that a Cactuar enemy can use an ability to change into a Giant Cactuar during a fight? In fact, that's the only way to encounter a Giant Cactuar. Considering it takes a long time until it uses the ability, you'll have beaten the Cactuar way before it does it. How would you know to wait for Cactuar to morph into Giant Cactuar without looking it up on the internet? I have no clue. How would you know where to find the missing monsters, actually nevermind, how would you even know which monsters you're missing from your list without looking it up on the internet? I have no clue once again. I suppose you'd just go map by map and try to spawn all the monsters until you thought you had them all.",Not Recommended,

The cool thing is that it allows you to go back and redo places, visit anywhere you've already been, and I like how they switched out sneaking up on enemies for preemitive strike. Its golden. You get to have up to three creatures from the game set in to switch up your party so you can run things like Relentless Assault, Tortise, tri-disaster and any of your paradigms from the old game which is pretty sweet and I like how you only have two permanent members of the party for simplicity in leveling people up (not that keeping track of everyone was bad I'm just lazy).

I don't know if I've matured to some degree or if the Japanese style writing has gone downhill so much. I watch Japanese movies occasionally and they still come off great every now and then. Japanese game writing though, Death Stranding, FFXIII-2, and the Kingdom Hearts series in general have no sense of real human emotion, everyone comes off as an atypical anime action hero. They feel sad when the story insists it upon them to. They are happy just to get the other character happy. Lets tell the viewer why they are sad and when they bond they'll just tell each other they are bonding.FFXIII-2 has only two main characters and they some how develop them less than the 5 of the previous effort. We spend time jumping back and forth through timelines while the narrator discusses the perils of defying fate. The main villain seems to note defying fate is wrong while defying fate itself. While the game is not the hallway that FFXIII is, it still is rather limited. you get to go to different world, meet up with old friend. You never stay in an area long enough to get a connection. You travel time to see who its like in the past and future, but nothing like on the scale of Link to the past or even ocarina. Each era is basically nailed down to as a Mario 64 level. Lets do this objective to get a star, move on to next level. There isn't any moment of urgency. We do what we do to ""fix the timeline and find Lightning"". We know at the beginning we are not fixing the time cause the narrator tell the audience we are in the wrong. Lightning is a god like being who can see the future, so there is literally nothing that I can empathize with her as well. She tells us what will happen in the story too. Noel sorta has an arc, but thats it caius and Serah don't do much really in evolution. I've been a fan of the Final Fantasy and Squaresoft/Enix RPG's since playing FFX and Kingdom Hearts. My point of entry is important when trying to explain my perspective on this game and the franchise as a whole. I haven't play FFXIII in a decade so bare with me. I enjoyed FFXIII for what it was, an okay story about fighting fate. The consequences of which are thrown upon two of the main characters, who may or not be homosexual. The characters are great. Vanille and Fang at least are. They have layers and different facets of their ""personality"" emerge depending on who they interact with. The only two wet blankets could be Snow and Lightning, but they serve the archetypal purpose of strong stoic character, and another who is romantically in love. The thematic link between all the MC's are wanting to protect someone who seems fated to die/leave. They all fight the power, oppressors, and it leads to being able to get what they want. Besides Two of the main characters, because they were the cause of much of the suffering. Thesis statement: who defies fate, should they defy fate, what are the consequences? Answer you can, you must, consequences are worse if you hold off presumably. Even then the ending is ambiguous enough to allow the viewer the freedom to decide what was right themselves.Final Fantasy X(favorite) top 5 of ALL TIME, sort of begins like an Isekai anime. You are thrown into the world without any prior knowledge. You learn and feel for the racism of the Al Bhed and Rikku, Yuna as half Al Bhed draws parallels to the half Guado villain Seymour. The main characters abandonment issues are address directly through out the game in his fathers character interactions through flashbacks and indirectly through inner thoughts of Tidus. The religion portrayed throughout the game is shown with reverence and is heavily catholic inspired. It works to help draw the player into believing in the use of the religion for the characters. Then slowly they dish out the relevatory lies. You learn through minor characters and Historians what the world used to be like. While everything in the beginning is explained exposition they still have cutscenes to show ritualistic dances and movements to add more culture to the religion. While 10's characters may not be the most exciting they all have interesting personality quirks and a arc. This with an innovative level up system and great story with scope. This is not even mentioning how every area to me is memorable. Maclania crystal, moon flow, a river on an elephant with shumi bluemen. Farplanes, thunderplanes... This not even mentioning again the fantastic sequel which finishes minor character arcs, MAECHEN!!!! FF7 the supposed classic. I remember hating the story the first time around. I replayed it sometime in 2019 and was surprised at how much the game tries to be the best game ever made. Pushing the playstation to its limit. Expressive character movements portray emotions such as anger and sadness. The music is sweeping and sprawling. I love the way it plays with memory and trauma. Theres nuance, for a story about an evil corporation, which ff 13-2 is lacking altogether. Shinra the company is not all evil AVALANCHE is not all good. Like 10 it has great pace which drops off in the second and third disc. Still great and charming. The cursing is absolutely sublime. The sh!t Cid and Barret says to Sherry and Cloud respectively. FF6 second favorite, drops off right at the end. Amaxing sprite work each character has an arc. WOR is a doozy, but thats another plus.FF 9 is pretty close to 6, but its been awhile. I started to replay in 2019 and was struck by the visuals and fun MC's. It looks like picture book or a stage play. I found it odd the hate for the game. I get not liking 8, but come on FF games are mostly cute. FF8 I like more than 7, but its been so long. It has ""realistic"" visuals, but it still has the classic humor even if its a bit dryer than FF7. A lot of things stick out visual but the characters are probably the least interesting.Anyway 13-2 is charmless with competent gameplay. It was not short enough. Feel free to disagree! ;D",Not Recommended,

Kain Klarden,32.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/,"March 24, 2016",1,"WARNING, this is a recommendation with a huge list of ""BUT""s and things you need to know and is very much not a glowing one. And first thing to know - do NOT play this game with steam cloud on, turn it off before you even start in the game library properties, otherwise the game will crash very often during ""now loading"" screens and attemtps to switch to offline saves mid-game will result in infinite loading screens for that game, unless switched back to cloud saves. Also, the game port is pretty buggy, you should search for a rain effect fix if you value your eyesight and the game will load like 1/5 times when you launch it, just keep trying.So after this lenghy ""the port is horrible"" opening let's get to the actual game. What's good about it is that it actually tries to use all those ideas found (and wasted) in Final Fantasy XIII properly and succeedes in many cases. All RPG systems and mechanics are still flawed, but are much more fun to play with, battles are less boring and actually require some thought and the progressions is rather open. The levels are no longer ""go from point A to point B in a corridor"" and while they're reused constantly with variations via the whole time traveling plot, they're mostly fun and look good. Game has a system similar to oldschool random encounters, which is both good and annoying. There are horrible puzzle sections, although they are ussually tied to optional areas and quests. And there are few super annoying and boring platforming sections, but the game is not too insane with those.What is also good is that the plot is happening. It's weird to put ""this storydriven RPG has plot"" as a plus, but after FF XIII that has nothing happening for dozens of hours, having things happen, story expand, characters develop all the time is great. The story itself is, like with FF XIII, more interesting in theory than in execution and few twists and turns feel not just silly but completely undermining some of the other stuff, but it has moments. And is surprisingly darker than you might expect. But overall, storytelling and themes are good, waaaay better than hours of nothing from FF XIII, even if a lot of stuff feels stupid or absurd and tone can be off by a lot.It looks good, it sounds very good, if sometimes unexpected (soundtrack switches from usual FF, to Resident Evil/Parasite Eve 2 feel (same composer), to Devil May Cry 3-4 in seconds and always catches you off guard). It has very welcome tweaks to UI and controls. It's a bit too experimental for it's own good. But it's also pretty fun. Not something to go into for a full price, especially with the port quality like this, but a pretty interesting jRPG nonetheless.",Recommended,

It's a grim reminder that ""time travel is really hard to write about *sobs*"" (--Dean Pelton).  The combat system is as monotonous as the first game in the 13 series and I nodded off quite a few times.  The levelling curve was also awkward with several areas consisting of enemies I can barely kill and then all of a sudden every boss encounter I have lasts barely 10 seconds.  There's quite a few boss fights that are just cheesy and have instantkill mechanics.  Aside from those, most of the boss fights are simplistic.  The game essentially doesn't respect the time of the player, makes progression quite vague, and involves a lot of walking back and forth, which may explain why I ended up outlevelling the content.  My opinion of this game may be clouded by how good Chrono Trigger was by comparison.  If you take the awful bits of Chrono Cross and cram it into a game, you essentially get FF13-2.Gameplay: 2.5/5Story: 2/5Music: 3/5Fun: 2/5PS:  One thing I really liked was the concept of Paradox Endings.

MuspellPete,22.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/muspellpete/,"January 26, 2015",5,"The game has in many ways improved on the FF13 formula, though it has one major addition which made it a lot less enjoyable for me compared to the previous game. In FF13 all mobs you were going to fight were visible on the path in front of you with the exception of some triggered events. In FF13-2 most mobs spawn on you randomly, . It is possible to outrun these and avoid the fights in most cases (unless you are in tight corridors, that is), though this feature still severely detracts from the game in my opinion. Pokemon is a fun game, but if you are like me, and get to a point where you just cringe every time a new random encounter interrupts your progress, when you for instance are searching an area for an item, then FF13-2 will probably irk you the exact same way.It has of course been a key feature in many of the older Final Fantasy games, though is harder to stomach in this modern installment, especially after playing through FF13 first. I suspect this is due to the way enemies were themed to their location in older games. In FF13-2 they can literally spawn in from different timelines, meaning the fights are completely disjointed from the area you are currently in (for the most part, anyway).I played through FF13 twice, and it's a game i love despite it's flaws, though i do not think i will ever finish FF13-2.

Maps are no longer corridor shaped, your party is modifiable from the start, and exploration / puzzle solving is at the forefront. Some of the things in this game are done significantly better than its predecessor while others might honestly be worse. Namely, the story's overarching explanation of anything and all things weird is ""It's a Paradox, Kupo!"". Without given an entire synopsis of the game, you and your party are tasked with restoring the timeline to its former glory and fixing the future by doing so. Overall, some of the mechanics and writing are cheesy but other times they are well played out. The reason I remember this game so fondly is because of the soundtrack.

Oh, and the +50% ATB rate weapons are OP, totally OP. Since you get them, there isn't anything else worth looking when it comes to weapons (MAYBE +1 ATB weapons for that 6 ATB segments action lol)Story: Interesting, yet somewhat disappointing and too short for my taste (when this game was coming out, I was hoping for the title that would be like FFX-2 was to FFX). Tbh I liked FFXIII's story better despite its linear feel, but it does not mean FFXIII-2 sucks in that regard. It has some awesome and funny moments, plus you decide what to do next (you can techically get ~140 fragments before beating the main plot, but that would make the final boss battle laughable considering the amount of CP you will acumulate throughout the game). Overall, it's damn dark compared to the first title and, let's be honest, how many FFs are there where the ""bad guys"" actually win?As for the DLCs, PLAY'EM! the boss battles are a lot better than the main story (read ""more difficult"").Replayability: The amount of combinations that there is when it comes to Serah/Noel stats is just astonishing. Every player is able to create his/her own, unique character setup with the new CP system, that does not make your characters unstoppable. Each development strategy has its strenghts and weaknesses, and leads to different late game scenario, which is shaped by person's individual needs when progerssing though the game, A BIG PLUS for that.Is this game better than FFXIII?

What I got exceeded my expectations by a long margin. This game is - believe it or not - .But first things first.It is terrible. Just plain awful. Even if you thought the story of the first Final Fantasy XIII was fine and never left any questions unanswered, XIII-2's story will most likely go over your head. I have to admit, it lost me very early on. It  makes sense in the end, but then again...not really. Don't try to wrap your head around it.It's not even the fact that it is about time travel, which in itself has always been one of the most confusing topics in movies and video games, no, it's just that the story writer went and took a rather simple concept and filled it with lots and lots of 'technobabbles' and weird pseudo-scientific assumptions to make it sound more complex than it actually is.Some of the dialogues in this game reminded me of what it feels like to watch an episode of Star Trek.Half the time they don't make any sense. Other times the characters just blurt out seemingly random thoughts and assertions, which we are - apparently - supposed to take for granted. More often than not they just make up the rules as they go along.It starts with lines like : To which to the  answer is:(You'll hear the "" paradoxes did it"" bit a lot.)Or how about this one from the casino:Just.....go with it. There is only one real way to play this game in my opinion. Turn your brain off, don't think too much about what's happening, take in the atmosphere and relax whilst listening to the phenomenally good soundtrack.Which leads me to the next bullet point.If you compare it directly to Final Fantasy XIII, then this game is undoubtedly much more open. Every map has lots of secret (and sometimes invisible) stuff to discover in every corner. And I personally just love the attention to detail everywhere, like when your character's foot step noise dynamically changes depending on the surface he's walking on, including small puddles on the pavement, or when you use your weird 'Moogle Magic' and every NPC in the vicinity gathers around in curiousity. The world generally feels alive and is really atmospheric.My only gripe is the way they handled invisible level bounderies. It is kind of immersion breaking when your characters can jump up towering trees that are dozens of meters high, but at the same time the knee high rubble in another area proves to be an insurmountable obstacle and you need to ""find a way around it"".Some of the aforementioned items you can find allow you to unlock more and more areas and side quests. Speaking of side quests though, the area selection hub does - in my opinion - a poor job in distinguishing the main story line from side quests. With how often I traveled back and forth between different time lines and areas I wasn't always quite sure if I was doing a mandatory or an optional quest. And in some cases a quest is even optional in the beginning, up until the game tells you that it is now mandatory for the story progression, and you realize you already did all that 6 hours ago. Oh well.The missions itself feature a good variety of objectives. Nothing  out of the ordinary, but they usually require specific actions in specific locations and times to change something along the time line. It never felt like i was doing boring chores.Now let's get to my favorite part of the game.Aside from walking around and talking to NPCs, the field gameplay features small 'puzzles' every now and then. Most of them are insultingly easy, though. Some of them are plain annoying.Now, the battle system is largely the same as XIII's. However, it has one neat little addition. You can now recruite Pokémon to fight at your site.I have to admit, I'm a sucker for the Shin Megami Tensei series and its demon recruiting and fusion mechanic. And Final Fantasy XIII-2's system is kind of similar to this.Whenever you kill a monster there is a chance to 'capture' it. You now have your very own lvl. 1 version of this monster with basic abilities, which you can either keep leveling up with specific monster materials (random drops, loot; can be bought later) or you decide to infuse it, in order to pass some of its abilities on to a stronger monster. This way you can spend dozens of hours trying to create unique and powerful allies. Unfortunately, as much as you can customize your monsters, the same thing does not apply to your main characters. Their level progression is much more set in stone. Both of them have obvious roles they excell at. Like, Serah is a much better Ravager than Noel, while Noel is the better Synergist and so on, so you obviously want to focus on these first.Additionally, the very high encounter rate lets you accumulate way too many CP (exp) too quickly, leading to overleveled characters, who steamroll every story boss in a matter of seconds (both main characters even stopped learning new abilities about 30% and were completely maxed out a little over halfway through the game).Speaking of encounters in this game, they technically aren't random encounters, as they appear on the map in front of you and you could theoretically avoid them. This is easier said than done, however, as many of the enemies move significantly faster than you and hit you before you can escape.One thing I did like about the encounters, though, was how in some locations there is a rare chance to spawn significantly stronger monsters than usual. Sort of like optional bosses who randomly appear in certain regions.And don't worry, even if you manage to die at any point, you will never lose anything. You have the option to retry any battle at any time and the game generally autosaves left and right.The autosave feature also reminds me of my final bullet point.Lets get this straight. The PC version of Final Fantasy XIII-2 is one of the worse console ports out there. Thus, it can and will randomly crash during loading screens.  it autosaves everytime you enter or exit an area. So, I never lost any progress, personally.Another problem is the awful frame rate. Currently there is no surefire way to fix the frame rate stuttering, everyone has. Forcing V-Sync and triple buffering and disabling the weird 'maximized windowed mode' (yes, the game runs in windowed mode, even if you choose the full screen option in the launcher) made it somewhat bearable for me. Some of the more populated areas will most likely always cause problems, though.If they ever manage to fix these issues, this whole point becomes moot.  But until this happens, the game may or may not give you a headache due to its unstable framerate.",Recommended,

I tried this game(P2) years ago after beating Part One(P1) but I couldn't play it for a variety of reasons. So, bad stuff first so you can work through it.P2 has to be modded. Don't even try to enjoy it before modding it.1 - P2's volume is all over the place. Even after receiving a mod for the music, I still found not only the song volume was all over the place from song to song, but the battle sounds were still much louder than the voices, so sometimes when characters talk during battle(like when we hear Yeul talking), we can't actually hear them over the noise of battle. If you decide to mod the music, I suggest you set it to 60-80 percent, depending on how tolerant you are of the annoyingly loud songs that are in P2. You could also just make multiple versions of the music, including some over 100 percent volume for those zones where you really want the nice and quiet music to be louder without blowing your ears off with the interface/battle sounds.2 - P2 crashes almost constantly because of the mandatory autosave feature. Workaround for this is to disable steam cloud support for it, sadly.3 - The graphics are not optimized for whatever software/hardware is used. I had to change the 3D settings for P2 according to some very old guide to get it to be smooth and play better.It's trying to give players OCD.4 - The story and side quests blend together so much that the only stuff that really feels like true side questing is their equivalent of 'Gold Saucer' but on the plus side compared to P1, at least it has a Gold Saucer. P1 made me feel like the side quests were part of the main story. Most of P2 has me repeatedly going back to zones for little to no reason and being inconsistent with whether I can complete or undertake a mission, sometimes I could have the mission completed before it's assigned to me, other times I have to wait for I don't even know what to get things to trigger.5 - Vercingetorix, the Doomherald...one of the unnecessarily difficult marks from P1 has got the same move list as and looks like the mark named Yomi in P2. Why don't they bring back a cool mark like Ruby/Emerald Weapon or something from FF8/9? I don't think it's a fun idea to have us do it again in here. Long Gui is back, too. Makes sense though I guess but what about the other turtles/tortoises? Neochu seems to be not here though which is a relief, just the weaker Ochu.6 - Exploration is a burden sometimes. I wish the game had encounter-none available, this would be the best solution to this mess. It has encounter fewer but couldn't get it until the game was nearly already finished which is completely different from my experience in FF8 where encounter-half and encounter-none were both available relatively early if effort was made for it.7 - Even if P2 isn't crashing due to steam cloud autosave glitching, I still find I have to go to the Historia Crux(timeline) before something happens so I can save to another save slot. Going to the timeline will automatically save, so trying to save after something happens to a new slot is impossible. This is a rather annoying flaw, but since the game is meant to be played again and again, I can't go back and catch the story action again any time soon, but eventually instead. Which can be very irritating, especially if I wasn't expecting story action. Thankfully, story action can be paused, but I'm not particularly used to doing this.P2 has made some worth-while improvements over P1. Time for the good stuff.1 - I can change the leader during battle. This allows more control during combat compared to P1.2 - Monsters can be recruited, which is interesting, although it's one of those things that could have a better set of data for the player so they don't feel forced to look at guides for the sake of their third party member(TPM). Although the 2 main characters in P2 have access to job names identical to those from P1, they have some significant limitations which are made up for with the TPM's power/flexibility, which is kept in check by the fact players can only switch between 3 different monsters in a battle(each is a single job character). 3 - Those points above bring life into the combat system which is an important part of any RPG. There's no shortage of enemies that are undefeatable and enemies that are challenging to keep players wondering about the game. This is the plus side to the minus of constantly feeling like I'm going back and forth like a ping pong ball unlike the way a traditional RPG feels.4 - Outfits are pretty interesting. I can use the default outfits for Serah and Mog, as well as her sidekick Noel, or some alternative outfits. However, there are not very many outfits for them(except for Mog). Black/White Mage outfits are the good ones. I like Cat the most for Mog but I would like to assume with so many outfits that many people like some other outfits more. The outfits work very well and-are-present in most cutscenes.5 - P2 has a guest fighter in one of the zones which brings back the nostalgia from many of the previous FF games.I also think it improves in at least one way compared to FFX-2.6 - P2 includes music from P1 although it won't happen in the first zones accessed. I like good music, and some of the best songs from P1 make a return in P2.7 - I dislike that they took away everything from FFX's combat system when making FFX-2. It had a decent combat system in its own right, but for a sequel it felt kind of bad not improving upon the old. However, I don't think FFX's combat system was as bad as FFXIII's. Using any older battle system, even if it was a poor one, and then making it better? Big thump up from me.Will update the review after doing the post game content.",Recommended,

MewichieB,0.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MewichieB/,"December 16, 2023",1,"Tldr; Low FPS, Visually Unappealing, Music is Hit or Miss, Story is Final Fantasy, Battle System is Boring. I've always wanted to try this title out. I've been told to avoid the first instalment and start with this one. Of course the PC version is a terrible port, however, there are awesome people who've done their best to patch up this game. Sadly, it doesn't do too much. The game will always run around 20 FPS when in the over-world and battles are below 40. This wouldn't be a problem if it was consistent. Despite having all the additional fixes/mods, the game doesn't look too great. I understand it's from the X360/PS3 era, but man, Grey sure is my favourite colour. Everything looks washed out and bland and for some reason the character models just look ugly (to me at least). Even applying the Xbox Button Prompts patch, the game refuses to show them. If you wish to apply any additional patches, you have to start over and apply *every* patch again in a certain order. Not worth the time or energy to get this game going. Play any other FF game (a part from other FFIII titles).As for the game play, it's automation. You don't do much besides *watch* your characters fight. Your choices don't seem to matter (for the early portion of the game) as the game encourages you to Auto-Battle. The only thing you have to do is Paradigm Shift which isn't thrilling. I wouldn't mind slogging through the mind-numbing battles, but the story is not interesting (again, visually unappealing), the English Voice Direction is god awful and dialogue is sped through with no one having chance to breathe. If you find early 2000s anime dubs to be funny, this will be for you. You're best off watching the cut-scenes on YouTube instead of playing an Auto Battle game.",Not Recommended,

Coco,72.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bisquetta/,"October 2, 2015",0,"It's imperative you do research before purchasing this game, unfortunately.

Depending on your rig, this game either works fine or with a tonne of issues (if at all). Sadly, I am in the latter group.However, the game itself is really enjoyable. I originally played it on the PlayStation 3 so I have prior and relevent experience with it. It is a relatively easy game as far as Final Fantasy titles go - even moreso if you're a well-seasoned RPGer and spend a lot of time exp grinding / farming. Aside from the main content of the story, there are quite a few additional things you can amuse yourselves with: chocobo racing, completing the monster log, slot machines, additional areas to explore, min-maxing pets and of course, the PC version comes with all of the DLC included.The environments are varied and interesting, full of colour and detail. In addition to the main characters, you're able to capture and train a pet for the third party slot. They will fulfil a specific role (Medic, Saboteur, Ravager etc.) and you can build paradigm sets to suit your play style.FFXIII-2 is designed with casual play in mind, I believe. There's a catch-up cutscene every time you load a previously-saved game, to remind you of your progress in the main story missions.

Moralio,29.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/moraliosan/,"April 5, 2016",1,"As much as I didin't like FFXIII, it at least had a satisfactory, conclusive ending. Unfortunately we now have a sequel that basically throws it out of the window, because FFXIII-2s main focus is time travel. Poorly done time travel that creates plot holes the size of Jupiter.Throughout the game, you hop through several time periods to help unravel the overall story line. Unfortunately, this chopped narration left me confused on what the underlying tale was trying to tell. What is left is a jumbled, forced gibberish that some game designers called a story line. It also doesn't help that most of the plot is explained through long and uninteresting monologues, rather than actual cutscenes with dialogues. And when FFXIII-2 finally concludes with now infamous sequel-bait my only thought was ""Really?"".Also, be prepared to hear the word ""paradox"" at least five times in each cut-scene. It's a convenient maguffin that drives the plot forward.Combat system taken almost verbatim from FFXIII with all its ups and downs. Since your two protagonists are the only ""real"" party members, you now have a random chance to recruit monsters, which you can then add to your team. They all have innate paradigm, but you can level them up individually and even fuse them together to create stronger versions. Unfortunately challenge is mostly gone as 95% of battles are easily doable using auto-battle autopilot.FFXIII-2 tries so hard to fix some problems of FFXIII. Long corridors are gone and replaced by (mostly) open areas. There are actual side quests, various challenges, different paradox ""endings"", post-game content and a new game plus. There are also a handful of minigames located in poor-man's version of Gold Saucer from FFVII. All this makes for an overall better gaming experience. Base game took me 24 hours to complete, but I imagine that if were to 100% it, it would take at least twice as much if not more. Be wary that few pieces of content is locked on PC - nothing that modding can't fix.Port-wise it is a tad better than FFXIII. We now have an option to change screen resolution, shadow resolution and anti-aliasing (MSAA), but why do I have to use third-party programs to unlock framerate, fix minor UI problems and graphical glitches?Final Fantasy XIII-2 is another, after FFX-2, sequel that no one asked for.

Much more that I do, which is why I spent much more time on it than FF13.The combat in this game is changed and in some ways interesting. In other ways frustrating. The interrupting effects make for a lot of irritating encounters and moments in the game, and I feel as though I can manipluate the flow of battle much less. In some ways I find it better than FF13, in some ways I find it worse. The two should have a combat baby.While I appreciated that the monster party member makes for a diverse range of party builds, it also feels tacked on. I would have preferred to have had a third fleshed out character, access to more skills for all characters, and an improved crystarium. I also found it annoying that main characters had limited access to skills from each class.I did not care for the anomaly puzzles. This felt like a waste of my time. While I think the floor falling puzzle and the clock puzzle are interesting, they had no place in this game, and I do not need them tacked on in a nonsensical way to waste my time.After about 40 hours, this game began to crash often upon trying to go to new areas from Historia Crux. Disabling Steam overlay appears to have fixed this. By the time I obtained over 140 fragments and realized I had to kill every enemy in the game, and also fight some very beastly monsters, to finish all 160 fragments, I abandoned the idea of finishing the fragments and just beat the game.

The visuals are also spectacular in moments, particularly near the beginning and end, but a painfully padded middle-game really shows that they did not give nearly as much effort to the aethetics in the core of the experience. If you are able to get through a lot of the padding, you'll find a fun game with some moments on par with the high points in its predecessor, particularly the boss battles. Overall, though, the added visual options are a great touch and if you set your rig to maximize performance, you'll get some really smooth gameplay.

Ashley Schaeffer,6.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028352716/,"January 24, 2015",14,"The Final Fantasy series used to be good, nowadays... not so much. This coming from a guy who played the early FF games on the SNES and on various consoles throughout the years to current gen stuff. I used to enjoy FF games and looked forward to each new installment, nowadays... not so much. FFXV will probably be my last FF game, it looks promising... but sadly thats Square-Enix's MO nowadays... flash over susbstance, game looks stunning but lacks any depth and just feels hollow.FFXIII was a massive let down for many people for many different reasons, all of which have been well documented and beaten to death across all forms of media and review sites. I too found myself asking, What happened? The FF series began to slip with FFX and FFX-2, for me thats where it started to go down hill, save for FFXII which I enjoyed. Actually if you really want to pin point the beginnng of the end, its probably when Squaresoft partnered up with Disney for that horrible Spirits Within movie and the following Kingdom Hearts collaboration.I'll give Square-Enix some credit FFXIII-2 is a lot better than FFXIII, but honestly how could anything have been worse than FFXIII. The battle system is essentially the same as FFXIII except your third party member is made up of one of many different monster you can get throughout the game. The maps are a little less linear but your still hand held as you make your way through. NPCs actually exist now, aswell as some hubs/towns so some effort can actually be seen on Square-Enix's part. Getting a ton of negative backlash tends to make you not rest on your laurels and name recognition and makes you actually have to try, go figure. Adding Mog was a definite plus, how moogles were completely and utterly ignored in FFXIII was a joke. It would be like having a Mario game without Mario.Still FFXIII-2 has a ton of short commings. I logged about 7hrs on this before I finally tapped out, I couldnt force myself to even bother with it anymore. I'm also more than a little annoyed at how liberal Square-Enix is at borrowing and the re-interpretation/perversion of nordic mythos when it comes to things like Odin and Valhalla. I'm sorry but that is just pure ignorance and disrespect for the nordic mythos and if I was Square-Enix I would be wholeheartidly ashamed.I forced myself to complete FFXIII, literally forced/tortured myself because I kept telling myself that the game couldnt be this bad and that it had to get better at some point. I wasnt making this same mistake with FFXIII-2. I'm sorry but I'm not watching movies/cutscenes for 20+ minutes having story characters repeat everything dialouge-wise because I'm apparently to dumb to figure out things on my own and need to be hand held through everything. Not like it matters, the zones are still fairly linear so its not like I'm going to get lost at any point in time here. Maybe its because I'm older now and dont appreciate the newer installments of FF, or maybe its because I'm old enough to realize that the game really does suck this bad. Skyrim.That name right there sent a message to the once mighty Square-Enix. The revival of the western RPG is here and wont be going away anytime soon with studios like Bethesda and BioWare leading the charge. Even european studios like CD Projekt and their Witcher series of RPGs completely crush anything Square-Enix has released in the last 10 years outside of MMO gaming. Whats really sad, is that South Park: The Stick of Truth is a more compelling and complete RPG than FFXIII/FFXIII-2 is. Honestly.No one insitution can be great forever, Square and FF kind of remind me of Metallica, back in the day Metallica was the hottest metal band on the planet. Now its time for them to retire and be put out to pasture, that same amount of passion isnt there anymore like it once was. All anything nowadays is based off of name recognition and past achievements to mask how brutally bad the current product is today. Sad but true.Again maybe its just me and I've out grown FF, its just too Disney-esq for me to take seriously anymore.Thanks for reading.",Not Recommended,
PressMoreButtons,14.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PressMoreButtons/,"June 25, 2021",0,"I'm going to revise this review. I had initially given up on this game due to mysterious bugs that hampered my experience. I can't say what the cause was, but since it stopped, I was able to get through the rest of the game.I'll keep it short. This game is gorgeous. It came out back in 2012, and it holds up great. The OST is fantastic as well, and I'd rank it among the best of the series. Gameplay-wise, it branches off from XIII a bit in terms of how it handles the crystarium and party composition. It's a straightforward upgrade path, but you can choose other roles and perks for the characters as you progress. Catching and outfitting monsters is cool, but not having a party is a bummer. Boss battles are pretty fun in this game. The combat events are a flashy and fun way to end a battle. It's a nice additional touch. They also seem faster than in the previous game. Or perhaps just shorter in general. Switching paradigms also doesn't pause the game like it used to, so combat flows more smoothly. The levels in this game are far more open, which is somewhat refreshing. There are times where you REALLY don't feel like having to run to given locations, though. You do have access to chocobos to make travel a bit faster. Got a nice chuckle out of the red chocobo. You'll know what I mean when you get one.The story is a whole lot of nothing for most of the game, due to 85% of the game being a search for Lightning. Expect a lot of ""Wait, what?"" moments, as things get confusing at times, especially as you approach the end. The game isn't exceptionally long(if you don't do too much extra work), so it largely doesn't overstay its welcome. Well, sort of. You will spend a significant amount of time (upwards of 2 minutes average) waiting for the game to load when going to a time period. Sometimes entering battle can yield significantly long load times.That can be grating, especially if you're looking for particular things between areas or, god forbid, grinding for materials. Outside of that, it's alright. I got some Hope out of it. You will have to apply a mod or two for this game to be playable. FF13fix(fixes the majority of problems this game has) and Leviathan's Tears(fixes the rain textures). Note that you may still run into a strange bug or two. Game was doing funky things with my controller for quite some time. If it works, it's fine. If not, well, you don't have many other options. I don't think anything can be done about load times, unfortunately.I do like this game. Not more than the first one overall, but it can be a fun time. I like that Square did try to set this one apart from XIII, and it does have some cool ideas. The openness is a nice contrast, even if there are instances where you'd rather just get to the point. Battles flow more smoothly, and boss fights are mostly pretty fun. The monster capture/raising aspects add a bit of variety to party composition, and some of them damn near trivialize the game, so it's rewarding in a sense. There's plenty of optional content to do if you're interested, so you won't get bored anytime soon, provided you were enjoying yourself to begin with.The main problem is just the  port. It's a damn poor job. If you are a patient man, like myself, you can manage to get through this. If you haven't played Final Fantasy XIII-2 before, I would recommend the PS3 version. It runs more smoothly than this. Due to the variable performance, I would not buy this at full price. It's playable, as your computer can probably brute force it at this point, but it would benefit hugely from a fix patch. For 10 bucks, it's fine. It can be fun, albeit kind of directionless. YMMV. I can't strongly recommend it, but if it works, it's worth trying.",Recommended,

The quick-time events are all coded in keyboard keys, but if you switch to an xbox controller, it doesn't give you an option to change it to xbox symbols, so you are left to figure out wtf backspace is on your controller. Quality of game: had me at first. thought it had a really interesting concept, but after i progressed through the game, it turned into one of the most tedious and frustrating things ive ever played. Key items you NEED to have in order to progress are hidden away in some of the most unintelligible and impossible locations. If you are going to have super difficult to find items hidden away in your game, DO NOT MAKE THEM ITEMS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO PROGRESS. I can almost 100% guarentee you that no one will complete this game without a walkthrough or a love for grinding. That or maybe getting lucky. If may not have been as straight-forward as the first installment, giving you a bit of freedom, but its at the cost of the game being extremely tedious and downright impossible at timesAdditional thoughts on game: level-up and role system was dummed down and poorly explained. Combat through out this game was either a brainless menu simulator that was so easy that i never needed to heal and would just stay in relentless assault and kill everything in 1-2 turns without grinding, or it would be downright impossible. FF13-1 was way harder, but there were strategies to beating difficult enemies and it didn't ALWAYS come down to just grinding more, there were usually a few work-arounds. This game is all about just being stronger because some enemies will just be too hard to take down, period. I find it hard to believe this game came out not that long ago.",Not Recommended,

It's even more frustrating for me because i'm really curious about the pet system, seems really cool. I don't know if SE plans to release a performance patch, hope so, but i really doubt it. Buy it on console if you want to try it, unfortunately i don't have a ps3.EDIT: I have been able to try it out with a better computer, and now I can talk about the different aspects of the game, there have been some improvement compared to FFXIII like when the character you control die, you don't have the game over immediately which is nice. What I don't like is: you only have 2 boring and generic main characters and that's all, hard to play when you don't like the MCs, the music: it sucks so much it makes my ears cry, and that's coming from someone who like FFX-2 OST (which I think is great, but I know that most people hate it). The gameplay is pretty much the same as FFXIII.

Advice and Recommended to play.   4. Finale. 1. Intro.  First, If you Have Windows 10, dont buy this. Most problems are held buy people with Windows 10 but not held by others. It isn't properly supported, dont get it.  Next, I've played this game for 200+ hrs,By saying this, most gamers understand the amount of experience I have with this story-based game that can be finished in 40-70 hrs, compared to an angry review after 2-10hrs of blindly butting heads with the terrible *edit* bad, port. This is a review by someone who has played through this game for a significant amount of time.  2. Why this should Honestly Not be Recommended,   a) This review is from a gamer that played this PC version for months I want to say that I Honestly think this is a great game brought from the PS3, but the performance put out by the port isnt very good. Unless your PC runs at some amazing stats, Its hard to play at anything other than the base image settings and the FPS is still pretty bad.   b) One of the Biggest problems happens during Cinematic Cutscenes, your game will try to load a lot of new information and also try to autosave which worked on the console, however the longer you play the game, the more information the game will tryto process. i.e. completed/ongoing quests, certain events that need to be implemented, and the biggest thing are Savestates which will take a significant amount of processinging all occuring in the small amount of time oof moving between the world you are in, and the World Select. Whenever you transition between worlds, which in mid to late game is a significant amout of times, this game will try to load , process and save all at the same time. During the early game this problem isn't very apparent, but at 40+ hrs, the change becomes much more apparent, eventually past 100+ hrs triggering even small cutscenes, which automatically load and autosave at the same time, will often crash the game, causing whatever progress was made to all feel worthless. While the game itself is fun and engaging, with a great story, and  good design, the PC version has its issues.   c) Occasionally, if the amount of data in your Savestate is fairly high, (100+ hrs worth, but possibly less.) Steamcloud, where all default savestates are managed will randomly""move"", essentually deleting them. Meaning that they are no longer accessable to you from your Main Menu or found any where in your PC's Files, leaving only the New Game option available. 3. Recommended and advice  a) Steamcloud shouldn't be turned on while playing this game. There is a warning on the Launcher stating that processing may take longer because of Steamclouds synchronisation with the servor. The fact that there is any kind of Warning on the launcher should be a clear indicator that there is a problem.There will be planty of times that SteamCloud will start synchronizing and crash your game. It would be best if you played this while in offline mode, the trophies may be fun to get but if you want to enjoy this game its not worth the risk's.  b)  Make sure you create an independent Save file location that is not managed by Steam. Frequently delete unnecessary savestates, and you can keep the amount of information processed farther on in the game to a more manageable amount.  c)  Keep your settings low, again this port isn't the most capable, during the early game when the amount of data being processed is rather low, it should be fine to raise the settings to whatever your PC can handle, just remember that even if your game runs fairly smoothly later on in the game, cutscenes and loading processing requirements will grow at a steepening curve. Whatever you can do to help your game run smoothly even at the cost of quality is worth it.  d) Look up Crysterium and Monster Guides before you leave the first world. Like others in the FF Series this Game will seem fairly easy at first, but even moreso then prievious games, it will absolutly punish unknowing mistakes, stopping you from even reaching the late game, let alone post game. Leveling the Crysterium (Essentually Levels) is an irreversable process, that if left to a novice will cause any small mistakes in building your character, that might not be so relevent early on, will become devestating to those that want to enjoy the late game.  d.i)  Monsters play a huge role in this game, and just like with Crysterium, are a major part of the game that will eventually be the focus of your team, as in they will be the party member that you recruit, train, and carry you through the game.  d.ii) While its not neccesary to look up guides on these to succeed, it is reccommended, finding the Hidden Monster(s), that can become the Gods to carry you through late game and final bosses. Finding the correct Infusiuon Recipes to build them into said Gods, finding which monsters youll need to grind for in certain conditons. And realising before you kill certain indespensible and unrespawnable monsters that you actually need them and should save in front of them and soft reset if you dont get it until you do.4.  Altogether this is a great game. I would say that this Port has to many problems that havent been corrected, and can only be managed by the user who pays the full price for this, but then has to do the providers job of making it usable in order to actually play this. After playing over 200+ hrs on the PC version of this game I can say that for those who still want to purchase this after reading this review, follow the above recommended advice, and hopefully someday this game will be Patched enough That I can honestly Recommend this to prospecting FF Players.",Not Recommended,

Seriously. Steam shows me with 126 hours of playing time, but that's about 50 hours of ""playing"" and 76 hours of repeating battles over and over again waiting for the needed whatever to drop. I just spent 7 hours trying (without success) to get a Cactuaroni. This game isn't fun; it's punishment.3) Enjoy listening to the same 6 nerve-fraying songs over and over and over. If you love screeching violins and wailing women, you might even like the music, but only for the first 10 hours or so. then you'll either throw your speakers through the wall or turn off the sound altogether (there are NO sound controls in this wonderful port.)4) Enjoy missing most of the plot points because the voices are mixed way under the music so Caius and Yeul and just about everyone else mumble in the background drowned out by the screeching violins. Of course, you can turn on the large subtitles and just totally ruin any immersion.One final point: any game that tries to make me fight and kill Lightning is EVIL. Lightning is one of the greatest characters in the history of gaming. There is no way I will fight her. I will always have her back as she will always have mine.

This port is shambolic.But putting that aside and focusing entirely on the game, here's why I didn't like it.I was going to write a fairly detailed review but once I started it just seemed self indulgent so here's the bullet points;- Combat essentially plays itself, including high end bosses, I might as well just be watching the game, it's just an exercise in time wasting in the end and almost always involves the same strategy with one or two exceptions (Naabat, Yomi)- It made cellotaping down the L1 trigger something I'd even have to consider in order to get the lucky coin fragment in Serendipidy. No game should, under any circumstance, compel you to afk it in order to do something in it.- Characters may look fantastic for the most part, but they're all bland, empty ""so the story can happen"" types- I don't like (read: I hate) time travel (admittedly you might like it, but you're wrong and should feel bad.)I didn't even bother to drag myself through some of the post-game DLC content because it essentially boils down to time wasting just to watch the game play itself.To be clear it's rare that I don't do the majority of things a game has to offer, but I just can't see why I'd want to sit through yet another instance of debuffing boss, buffing self, push chain guage, heal as necessary, ooOo big attack better Sen/Sen/Sen ok cool blablabla repeat ad infinitum ok finally it died great. Just seems like I could find something better to do.If you're wondering how I did 63 hours only to write this review I'll have you know I'm a masochist.",Not Recommended,

If you want to get at least 1080p 30fps, I highly suggest that you put the settings to the lowest possible. Even while doing so, in battle the frames will drop to about 20fps. Outside of battle you will notice that hiccup in frames lost as well. FPS aside, there is a major bug when it comes to saving your game. The game will completely crash to desktop when you try to save the game, and if you do manage to save the game, you never know when that save crash will appear. It could happen right away, or 10 minutes later. So attempting to save every few minutes to hopefully not get that crash to save progress, is fairly annoying. From the brief amount of time that I played with the game, the combat is very familiar to the first game which is a welcome and the soundtrack was very well done as well from what I could tell. The addition of ""pets"" was a nice touch and the quick time events are a welcome addition as well.If you really want to play FF13-2, DO NOT buy this PC verison.

There are a couple minor improvements here - there's less of a delay when paradigm shifting, and there's no longer an ""on rails"" experience, with you spending hours pushing through narrow corridors. Also, important plot details and character motivations are no longer squirreled away in a text-based codex. Apart from that.... friggin' yikes. The paradigm battle system and leveling system are still in place, which is deeply unfortunate. Your cast of playable characters is boiled down to two, which makes the scope of the game feel small and the dialogue much less interesting. The plot is slapdash and nonsensical (and not in a fun, crazy JRPG kinda way), and is a major downgrade from XIII (which, at its core, had an intriguing concept of malevolent overseers and protagonists doomed to die). What really brings down FFXIII-2, though, is the fetch questing. You have to scour maps to look for gates, which unlock different areas. You need to unlock those areas to unlock OTHER areas. because inside those OTHER areas are..... invisible artifacts that you have to find and collect. But, oh wait, before you can unlock the FIRST gate or the OTHER gate you have to scour the world for DIFFERENT invisible artifacts (which you need to render un-invisible with your moogle). (Also, moogles talk in this game and it's terrible.)Separate from the fetch questing, the game's levels are massive asset flips. These gates you unlock are to revisit the same 7-8 areas in different time periods...... so essentially the same level with a swapped color palette. It's all tiring and boring and monotonous, and the fact that you only travel via gates means nothing in the game feels interconnected or large. Everything's small and tedious, like your two-player roster. The one major upside is that this game's runtime is under 25 hours. Couldn't have ended quickly enough.",Not Recommended,

Bad Stuff:I'm sure there is a great extra-convoluted fantasy story tucked away somewhere in the numerous Datalogs most wont read. But I didn't witness it outside of that. So much of the game stops you after 30 seconds of walking to subject you to a full dialogue of characters saying things in long form of little to no consequence. Remember old final fantasy games where a nice rounded rectangle would pop up allow you to read quickly the interesting dialogue? That's gone now. Also left on the cutting room floor is any real tactical form of combat, you get to pick battle styles once again in set styles then press one button for the rest of the game. How fun. You can go and see how many household activities you can do one handed with a wireless controller in the other mashing that one button while doing bosses or the random battles that pop up blocking you while you try and work out the inane puzzles you may find in the game.There is an unusual amount of running back and forth to find certain keys or do fetch quests, which somehow dilute the already drivel injected plot. Many of them are frustrating and pointless. It's almost like they had a special team at Square-Enix dedicated to editing out anything that made this game fun.Good Stuff:I enjoyed the voice acting by Liam O'Brien and Laura Bailey, although somewhat wasted.The proper cinematics are always a pleasure to watch. This does seem to be the most futuristic Final Fantasy has gone, its a pity that it was squandered. But the aesthetic in some zones was really cool.It was good seeing chocobo racing back, but it was executed with not quite the amount of necessity. Thankfully the abundant and superfluous dialogues are skippable.This is the worst game I've played in a while.

Mokipoki,2.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MokiPoki/,"February 14, 2015",2,"Let me preface this review by stating that I'm a long-time Final Fantasy fan, yet I am not a JRPG fan. That may sound confusing. I am not a fan of FF1-FF6 (I know some games are repeats in there, depending on the Japanese release). I have played FF7-FF13, and I wish I had skipped over this one. Let me explain below.GRAPHICS:The graphical fidelity is no better than FF13. That said, it's not an ugly game by any means. I noticed my laptop (which is not equipped for high end gaming) tended to chug harder and burn hotter than when I played the FF13 PC port...I found this strange, since I noticed draw distance tended to be better on FF13. You'll also note the lack of monsters and their animations on the overworld map. So...why is this game more taxing?PRESENTATION:It's not any uglier than FF13, that's for sure, but the characters are a lot flatter. We didn't get to see much from Serah in FF13, but in FF13-2 the actress seems a lot less interested and passionate. At times the body language is overplayed and at other times there's no body language beyond standing arms akimbo.SETTING:I could ask...what setting? A lot of reviewers have said that you don't need to play FF13 in order to play this game. That's true, but you won't understand anything unless you read through all of the FF13 primers on the main screen. Even if you do, the plot won't make much sense. FF13 was enchanting because it introduced a novel theme that seemed unfamiliar. A great purge of unclean civilians united six heroes who gain magical abilities to unite the citizens of a police-state world to overthrow their god-like leaders. Sounds nice, right? The setting of the sequel, FF13-2, builds off of that. But instead of introducing a unique or innovative story arch it starts from where FF13 left off. Our protagonist, Serah, can't remember what happened (how convenient) and she has been separated from her sister and her lover. A timelord deus ex machina character is introduced in the form of Noel Kreis. Lightning, Serah's sister, summons him from another plane of time and reality to do her bidding. The rest is in the plot development, or lack there of. But seriously...time traveling? My head already hurts.CHARACTERS:Noel is boring. Through the few hours I played he describes that he is from the future. Approximately 300 years from the present plot point. He explains that he has never known what a vegetable tastes like and that he is the last of man's existance. So why does he look so clean and handsome? And what is with his weird weapon? Nothing is explained. Noel's character design is meant to be ambiguous so we don't get too curious. It's lazy and it's flat. Skip over this character.Serah is boring. She acts like a scared little child when we're introduced to combat. Her feminization is peaked by giving her a bow and reducing her physical damage below what Noel is capable of. I'm not promoting or dismissing any sort of female rights, but I will point out that Lightning was an exception to this ""feminization of damage"" rule in FF13. Lightning was the female protagonist, and she was more than capable of putting out tons of damage as well as taking tons of it in return. She was by far one of the most powerful characters...so why isn't Serah?Kupo: Kupo? Kupo...why did they add a moogle to this plot? You will note that I avoided playing most of the games with a moogle in it. Well...there's a moogle here. He will plague your cutscenes and you will often find yourself hitting ""0"" and ""skip."" The moogle only makes Serah's sex more generalized.Any others, I didn't get to. I thought I might have picked up a new character after beating ""the hand"" in the second chapter but that was not the case. I don't know what other characters exist out there, but you will have to figure that out for yourself. I won't touch this game again.CUTSCENES: As I stated in the GRAPHICS section, the visual presentation is quite the same from FF13. That's a good thing. Most cutscenes look very nice. One thing that upset me was the introduction of Quick Time Events (QTE). This requires you to make a movement or button press based on a notification on the screen. From what I can tell the QTEs don't actually affect anything in the plot. Sometimes you will notice your character painstakingly and stupidly getting squashed by a giant meteor only to roll over and get back up. Sometimes failing these QTEs during a boss battle will result in extra damage. Likewise, succeeding a QTE might result in a status effect boost. This doesn't belong in an RPG. It ruined the balance and flow of the game, and should not have been included.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is very similar to FF13, but it feels like it behaves faster. Enemies seem to have less health, and encountering enemies is much different. You lack the techniques that you gain early on in FF13 and enemies aren't displayed on the overworld map. Instead enemies spawn randomly, and they seem to spawn based on the number of steps you take. After a certain number of steps enemies spawn and you have the choice of either running away or using the action button to swing your weapon and hit the enemy avatars. If you connect before they do then you gain Haste and surprise the enemy. If you take too long or the enemy runs into your overworld avatars then you initiate combat as usual.I initially thought this was kind of a cool idea. A lot of RPGs have an initiative system. However, I quickly realized this was just a gimmick to reduce on-screen rendering. It also builds an unfair disadvantage for tactics by not showing what enemies you're up against. All in all, this was a failure by the creators.Leveling up has become a nightmare. In order to create a simpler and more uniform character progression system the creators have done away with the traditional Crystarium of FF13 and have created a new ""Crystarium"" that allows you to choose which class you want to specialize in. This character progression system feels a lot like the FF Tactics games.I get where the creators were coming from. I am betting they received a LOT of feedback from FF13 explaining why the individual Crystarium stat point nodes were trivial. Of course you're going to level up for the least amount of CP, there's no point in trying to use statistics and levels to negate that. However, the solution here was horrible. Basically every ""level"" in the Crystarium is worth a certain point value--regardless of what you invest it in. Serah and Noel start with level 1 in Commando**, Ravager**, and Sentinel**. After you level up enough you can either gain a deeper specialization of these role trees or you can get an ATB segment or a new role. It is never explained who should specialize in what or how well rounded your party should be. In FF13 each character had specialized roles and some characters synergized with others neatly. I never got this feeling from FF13-2.SUMMARY:I give this game a 4/10. I know it's rough, but it simply did not capture my attention for more than a few hours. It's not a bad game if you like JRPGs that are a bit over the top. The fact that I enjoyed FF13 so much and yet I disliked this game really speaks volumes. You don't have impressive antagonists like Roche or the Fal'Cie. Instead your villain is some emo kid with an ugly looking ""sword.""**Let me just reiterate that a lot of reviewers state that you don't need to play FF13 in order to play this game. That's where they're wrong. If you didn't play FF13 then you have NO idea what these roles are. The in-game primers are brief, and they don't at all explain how important these roles are. I won't go into deeper specs of these roles, so if you're interested please look up a game guide.",Not Recommended,

Tephus,35.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972661723/,"June 29, 2023",1,very disney like but incredibly sad. If they ended the here instead of making lightning returns it woulve been a shellshock. Even with it being disney like id still say the story is great and the combat is basically a rehash of 13 but leveling monsters to act for the combat fields. Game performance wise after patches (thank you online strangers that care) is playable no crashes unless you are trying to stream it. If you stream it in some areas you will get a crash no matter what best you can do is screen stream instead of application and that reduces crash chances by alot but it will still happen. Through my non-stream playthrough i got 0 crashes/fatal errors. Also biggest complaint. The lack of volume control in game menu. There is a massive lack of any style option adjustments throughout every single game in this trilogy. Also the lack of an option to turn off chocobo riding music. It pretty funny first time you hear the rock version but it gets grating after that. Also the weirdest thing i noticed is if you move the mouse up to top of screen i cant remember if its this one or lightning return you get a drop down bar giving you some options. Weird how they couldnt just put that in the options menu in game. I give it a downvote for soul purpose of SQUARE needs to stop making horrible ports and terrible decisions when it comes to pc fan base. If it takes strangers to fix your buggy port then its just a terrible design of a company that relies on their customers to get them money.

To me when bosses have OP attacks that can potentially kill you or take away your entire HP in one hit there is no enjoyment to be had there just frustration. 4) Too many fragments to collect for the secret ending and side quests are boring, who enjoys bloody fetch quests? not many I don't think. 5) Becomes extremely grindy and when a game becomes too grindy my interest level starts to dwindle. 5) You can capture or crystalise monsters to fight by your side, the biggest highlight of the game to me.Not going to bother talking about the plot as explaining it would require me to type an essay so I suggest you look it up.Do I recommend this game?  well it depends on you really if you like a good story then go for it if on the other hand you don't like boring tedious side quests, really difficult boss fights that make you want to rip your hair out you might want to avoid this.I'm going to recommend this game based on my experience with it which I'm not going to get into here.",Recommended,

Helxx_Lutja,0.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198184385459/,"June 27, 2015",2,"This game is bad.  Shockingly terrible.  Endless, un-skippable cut-scenes and dialogue.  Why would I want to skip them in a story RPG?  Because they are astonishingly bad.  The direction of the film/cut-scenes are dreadful such that you have no idea what is going on.  The dialogue is so dreadful that the game-start intro sequence (that is identical to the unskippable) intro animation was better without the words.  Every sentence is, every single one is doom, foreboding and portent to a level indistinguishable from parody (but no-one is laughing)  You remember how the characters in old final fantasy games looked like whiny, poetry writing children but then usually turned out to be funny and violent? The characters in this game look *and* act like the most irritating of teenager stereotypes.  CINEMATIC ACTION! or real-time-events blah, blah  its fun looking at the instruction during a cut scene so that i do not see any of the action.  The action combat system combines the  necessary elements of real-time and turn based action such that all possible fun is removed.  The combat action is also almost hidden by camera angles, camera movement and interface elements. The characters speak every (awful) line in a way that is so slow and ponderous no further slowdown seems possible before encountering humorous audio-processing effects.  All final fantasy villains  have looked goth and androgynous - this cain guy here manages to look as physically harmless as the most anodyne of pre-teen pop 'stars' .  I literally could not tell in the 'voiceless' opening that he was supposed to be the villain as there is nothing threatening about him whatsoever (even when dropping mountains onto people).  During one of the 'interactive' periods it is also apparent that the game environment is as tedious as the characters and the plot.I am mystified as to how this game can be so bad ...and that *THIS* is the superior sequel !!!!!i love jrpgs.  The old final fantasies and I am currently having an absurd amount of fun with legend of heroes: trails in the sky.  this game is a turd and by all accounts even not even the worst of the series....and finally.

I have an Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 and an Intel I7 4770k with 16 GB system RAM. The game works just fine for me, however, when I try to play the game at 1080p, I find that the FPS is highly unstable. It goes anywhere from 20-60 FPS, depending on what is going on. Prerendered cutscene: 30 FPS (although the video itself was only rendered at 30 FPS anyway). In-engine cutscene: 60 FPS. Menu: 40-60 FPS. Running around: 20-60 (again, it depends on what is going on).Now, that being said, I have tweaked with the settings and I have found something that works for me:-Resolution: 1600x900-Fullscreen-Shadow Resolution: 2k-AA: 8xWith this setup I was able to play the game at a much more stable 40-60 FPS, depending on the situation. I will also note that I am using a device to measure the amount of wattage that my computer uses and I noticed that it uses almost the same amount of power as it does when I idle on the desktop.

Mikal,62.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikalichov/,"March 18, 2023",4,"First, yes, the performance is terrible. You will need to use various patches on several files of the game for it to even start. You will need to modify obscure Windows parameters for the game to not crash right after starting. Even then you will need to disable Steam Cloud for the game to not crash on saving. And even  you will need to find the right monitor for it to not crash randomly - too big monitor and it might crash on scene load, too many monitors and it will crash on fights, etc. And still the game will refuse to launch 1 out of 10 times, still you will have weird audio buzzing, still you will have frame drops in some menus for some reason.But that's not the worst IMHO. I've played my share of retro/emulated games, I don't mind fighting a bit the get the game in shape. I would have expected better from an actual Steam game but still I can handle it. But usually those games at least have the decency of being ok games. This game only rewards you with more crap.Let's see, you picked a JRPG, so maybe you were looking for a deep combat system? Lots of optimisation, management, leading to tense battles that test your wits and preparation? Nah, you get two stats and the whole game is you pressing auto-battle again and again and again.Oh, then maybe you wanted a diverse and interesting group of playable characters with who to travel and discuss? Tough luck, all you get are two characters for the whole game. They're not really interesting but they kinda discuss I guess? And they don't play different from each other due to the dumbed combat mentioned above.Ah but then it's ok you say, there must be tons of NPCs to encounter and chat with? Yeah. Around ten. And only three of them are new, the rest are just the PCs from the previous game.Interesting destinations maybe? Well it's better than the previous game I guess, not linear and you can actually explore this time. Let's see there are the ruins, the snow ruins, the sea ruins, the jungle ruins, the city ruins... Oh and there are inhabited areas this time! But for some reason everybody is living in ruins.And then there is the story. I could have accepted all the issues above, I kinda expected it going in - the previous game had almost the same issues. What convinced me to give it a try was the story - I mean time travel should be cool in at least some ways, right? Time travel means Chrono Trigger, means Radiant Historia, it's the dream.Don't make the same mistake I did. The story is nonsensical, poorly told, and tbh not really interesting. You have a bad guy that says what he wants to do and why from the beginning of the game, then you spend the whole game running around wondering what he wants to do and why. And then you find out that it's what he said at the beginning, wow. And all that time in the middle - and it's long, really long - is just people talking through cryptic sentences (""she calls..."" ""it happened again..."" ""it's too late..."") and hearing voices and talking a lot to say absolutely nothing. If you can, search for an example of the game's ""story so far"" summary, it's hilarious.Not only that, but the whole time travel thing is just used to justify making you go through the same maps over and over again. Literally nobody cares. You appear in a village with a big flash of light and they're like ""wow where did you came from?"" ""oh we're time travelers"" ""cool lol"". Or ""oh yeah I time traveled too"". You meet people from the first game 100 years in the future, and the only explanation they give is ""yeah I often get lost haha"". Sometimes they don't even give explanations, they just pop 500 years after the first game and everybody acts like that's normal.And then there are all the situations where one of the characters start reacting completely weird to stuff - one of your two characters meet someone from the first game and goes completely ballistic about it, flipping out, saying they hate this kind of people, etc. Before the guy even talked! And it stops as suddenly as it started.Honestly there are so many of those situations that I genuinely wondered if the people making each scene talked to each other. The last part of the game is kinda coherent I guess - as in unlike the rest of the game you get the same characters from one scene to the others, actions make sense etc, but the rest of the game really feels like each chapter was given to a different team with a quick pitch of what was supposed to happen and the result was put as is in the game.Anyway, that's it from me. I usually don't leave reviews of games unless I really want to convince people to play them, but I guess this is the first time I really want to convince people to NOT TOUCH THIS.",Not Recommended,

I'll highlight the worst parts of it, but first I want to make clear that any of it's many infractions would be sufferable were it not for the horrendousness of the ""story.""  Most of it simply makes no sense, but from what I can gather, there are time travelling asteroid anomolies from other dimensions.  This might seem strange, but in the game world, everyone is an expert on time anomolies, because you know... this stuff happens every day.  Honestly, my five year old niece could have written a more cogent and engaging story.Combat.  They took everything that was good about FFXIII's system out, and left us with everything we wish they'd improved upon.  Nothing you do matters.  I got through most of the fights in this game by simply setting my controller down, going into the kitchen and making myself a beverage while the NPCs finished the fight for me.  I got all the way to the end area this way, but then the enemies became so much more powerful that I've had to go back and grind these meaningless battles for hours upon hours to build up enough hit points to survive the end boss' attacks.Saving.  You can save anywhere, but evidently the time anomolies have infected the game's save system, because it routinely takes 2-5 minutes to save my game.Pacing.  Everything takes twice as long as it should.  There are load screens to load the load screens for the animations.  This game has more in common with a kaleidoscope than anything else.Characters.  Utterly forgettable.  Whatever their motives are, I don't even care.  I stopped listening hours ago.So in closing, if you enjoyed FFXIII as I did, be content to stop there.  This game does nothing to add to the game's world, story, or legacy.  Instead spend your $20 on some glass shards and salt to roll your eyes around in.

Vesicularbus683,51.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowthehedgehog111/,"June 19, 2016",3,"First and foremost: BUY THIS GAME FOR CONSOLE INSTEAD! YOU WILL RECIEVE NOT ONLY BETTER & MORE STABLE FPS, BUT YOU WILL ALSO RECIEVE BETTER VISUAL AND AUDIO QUALITY.Final Fantasy XIII-2 is the sequal to Final Fantasy XIII, but it makes itself a whole different game. While the battle system is the same as before, it spruces it up with the ability to use monsters as companions. This keeps battles fresh and gives you many options for paradigms. I personally like this in combat, but the cost of this is that you won't be gaining a third companion. Also the Crystarium is different. Instead of multiple different trees to grow, there is just one, and what you gain per sphere depends on the role you choose to upgrade. When you reach the end of the path your Crystarium will expand. Then you are given multiple choices to level up including increasing ATB and increasing the amount of accessories you can hold. I like this change as well. The two main characters are Serah, Lightning's sister, and Noel, a mysterious stranger from the future. The premise is that after Cocoon fell from the last game, Lightning vanished. A few years later, Noel appears on a meteor and begins traveling through time with Serah. The story from there is driven by each point in time you travel to. From what I've played so far, the cutscenes are mostly based on feelings instead of character development. This means that most players will find that they don't care about Serah and Noel. The story ends up being weak and unimmersive. To add on, the music is no longer orchestra, but is now electronic J-Popish music. If that's your style, then godspeed but I personally perfered the Orchestral tracks. A few minor  points are that now there are options to pick when you get in dialogue, the side quests are more varied than just helping a L'cie stone out, and there are quicktime events in some cutscenes.  But the main thing I have to complain about it is the quality of the port. It's terrible. No matter what you do, maybe unless you have a REALLY good computer, you will experience frame rates all over the place, but almost never over 30. Also the audio quality ends up being terrible, it sounds like the voice acters are speaking through a cheap headset instead of a studio microphone.So to summarize:Pros:                        -Revamped Battle System (Pets)-Crystarium Revamp-Time Travel makes the game less linear.-More Varied Side Quest Premises-Branching Dialogue and Quick-time events make the game more engaging than it would've been.Cons:-Story and Main Characters are uninteresting and melodramatic.-The PC port is terrible.So the bottom line is if you aren't a fan of FFXIII, look up different & better games.

Well, the PC version anyways.  The console versions are still fantastic obviously.I can't believe this.  Original FFXIII actually runs surprisingly well on my PC considering all the port issues, but FFXIII-2 runs like CRAP, even with the lowest possible settings (I freaking played FFXIII the day it launched on Steam and even then it ran WAY better than this).  There's got to be some bigger issues at play here as even people with very high-end graphics cards are reporting problems getting the game to run at a consistent framerate.  This is ridiculous, it's pretty much the same engine as FFXIII, and I remember it running a hair more smoothly than FFXIII on consoles, but it runs a whole heck of a lot worse here.Well, hey, that's nearly 30GB of space I can get back on my PC at least, and I won't have to feel even the slightest temptation to get Lightning Returns when it inevitably comes out.  Glad I kept my PS3 copy.Kind of a shame too, as Square-Enix frequently has PC sales, and the PC version includes most of the console DLC right out the gate (I think the only things not included are a few costumes and weapons and such, nothing major), plus the Japanese language track.I hate to do this, as the game itself is wonderful, but I really can't recommend the PC version at all.

(Because FF13 wasn't already full of bizarre yet somehow entirely uninteresting nonsense.) Random ♥♥♥♥ involves a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system where you literally do nothing but push the auto-battle button every turn.

The first thing it did is ask me if I wanted to view the tutorial. I said, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOso it responded by showing me the tutorial, which can't be skipped with the skip-scene feature.What the ♥♥♥♥ are these people even doing anymore?--to be continued when I feel like I can stomach more of this ♥♥♥♥--Cont.:So now I'm Serah, a character who is somehow simultaneously more annoying than Hope and Vanille combined.

Oh, and it's my sword/bow/gun, because why the ♥♥♥♥ not.And then there's Noel, who may as well inflate his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ parachute pants and fly back to Kingdom Hearts where he belongs instead of harassing me with his boring, one-dimensional, neverending monologue.I'm in a beachside village that's attacked by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens and all the people with automatic weaponry can't handle it because I'm the main character. So I suffer through a few battles using the same complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system from FF13 where I can only control one character and the auto-battle completely takes the point out of even showing up.After saving the incompetent villagers I rush the ♥♥♥♥ out of the place because Gadot's hairdo is terrifying af, and I head for the hills, only to discover that there's a new SUPER-IRRITATING combat init system where enemies poof into existence right next to you and you can run from them or slash them in order to avoid battle or start with an advantage. This is similar to the init system from some decent RPGs except that in those ones the enemies didn't appear out of thin air for no reason.I'm also constantly bombarded by asinine, unsolicited voice-over every time I look in the general direction of an NPC, which is part of the reason I passionately hate most western RPGs. Great job there, SE. Glad you spent money on that.I reached the alien rock that is apparently attacking my village and got attacked by a giant portal monster that died in about five seconds.

I am a bit of the way in to this one and have to say a couple of things about it. The plot is pretty interesting, its not as epic and deep as the first but its good. The combat system has only been improved and expanded on. The leveling system is simplified to a more choose your class role rather than being forced into a couple of classes. They have added a couple of things like summoned party members, monster synthesis and item crafting rather than just upgrading. The cons though:The game is lesser optimized. Even at the lowest settings my beast of a pc, while streaming, has frequent fps drops. Way worse than the first. It feels incredibly rushed in regards to optimization. The plot isnt as powerful, yet still decent. The world overall doesnt flow completely fluidly. The game feels very westernized. Which, to some people is probably a good thing. I dunno.Overall I recommend the game, its a good and solid rpg but I HIGHLY recommend the first one first before you play this.

The frame dips are hardcore and sickening, even way worse than in FF13 and Lightning Returns which both are also optimized like total garbage. I found a fps uncapper program that makes the game run much smoother but still has big time slow motion slowdown when running around bigger map areas which is often, although thankfully doesn't happen in combat. Even so, this is still a sorry, unoptimized, embarassing excuse for a pc port. The game itself is a good fun game on console, but I will not support Square being the worst company in history at making pc ports with a upvote for any reason.Hopefully they also don't use the auto battle system anymore that 13 and 13-2 use. It's decent, but just feels overly simplified. I mean I don't want the whole game to be as hopelessly convoluted as FF8 or FFX-2, but what was wrong with FF12's combat and game system? That is one of their best FF games. They even used its combat system for FF14 online which is saying something.Can't we just get a port of FF12? Actually no square nevermind I said that.

Gorast,18.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/somedude179/,"March 19, 2024",0,"Sorry to say, this game is a mess. There are elements at play that are really interesting - the inversion of the player's relationship with Lightning and Serah by making Serah playable and Lightning the non-entity she's chasing after, the same compelling, deceptively-deep combat system as the first game, the base elements of time travel and seeing the same places at numerous points on the timeline - but the rest of the game surrounding those elements is tragic in how bad and bland it is. The level design is the same linear pathway style as XIII, but most of the environments are dull and dingy since so many of them take place in dark, bad futures, plus you need to backtrack a bunch to progress the story so you're hitting these places again and again when they weren't interesting in the first place. The plot is basically the rough outline of a story, bolted together through the time travel mechanic, where it feels like very little happens at any given moment until suddenly the status quo drastically shifts. The roles the original party members serve vary wildly and, aside from Hope, feel completely superfluous, which is particularly egregious when you consider that Snow is literally Serah's fiancé, so you'd think his role would be significant. Ultimately, the game just feels like a huge slog to get through, and as the middle part of the trilogy, it probably serves as a hard gatekeep on Lightning Returns because people will assume you need to play XIII-2 to understand it and nobody wants to play this game so nobody plays Lightning Returns.The most egregious thing, to me, is that Lightning is used to sell this game, is on the box art and all the promotional material, and, for Plot Reasons, literally is barely in the game at all. I just think that's crazy - not anything inflammatory like ""false advertising"" necessarily, but the entirety of the game's plot hinges around her sudden absence which necessitates her NOT BEING ON SCREEN!! Like, don't use her as the mascot and the center of marketing, put Serah on the box! Sheesh.In short, if you really, really want to see the plot (for whatever reason), just watch it on YouTube and move on to Lightning Returns.tl;dr alyssa was perfectly justified in everything she did, if you know you know, don't play this game though",Not Recommended,

The idea is cute, and leveling your monsters in fun, but in the end it really felt like one more thing to grind out before I finished the game.13-2 is actually pretty forgiving with players who don't want to spend a lot of time engaging with side stuff. I was able to beat the game on easy with what felt like a pretty underleveled team with relatively minor difficulty.The story wasn't as engaging as 13, and I didn't love the cast as much, but it was an important bridge between 13 and lightning returns and it never really felt like it was overstaying it's wlecome.",Recommended,

One of if not my favorite final fantasy games of all time. this game uses the paradigm battle styem but puts a cool spin to it by allowing you to collect monsters that have certain roles on your team. This replaces the 3rd part member and becomes a really fun and cool part of the game where you catch monsters and level em up along with your characters. The game is a little bit shorter than the orginal final fantasy 13 but id say its even better. its not as linear, theres more exploration, a secret ending you can get by geting all the 160 fragments as well as the ability to time travel. Caius the main villain of the game is a really good character and has an even better voice actor as well as my favorite final fantasy character Noel. Id recommend beating the first game before trying out this game. playing the first one will not only help with the story understanding but also helps you master the battle mechanics. There is even a part of the game where you can face off against the villain again and get more clarification on the events during the story.

A confusing one to gather my thoughts on..by itself, it’s a good game with a unique time travel traversal mechanic and story. The combat is just as fun as the previous game. The puzzles and fragment hunting can get pretty annoying, but guides fix that. I think as a standalone FF game, it would be stronger, but it does feel like an odd filler episode after 13, only because the jump from abandoning the Fal’cie plot/lore and replace it with a time travel story seemingly out of no where felt jarring. Any connection to previous lore/story in 13 was minimal, to the point it felt like this time travel story could have been in any FF game really. It feels like we aren’t even in the same world of Pulse and Cocoon (beyond visually), mostly abandoning all the main characters from the prior game. It’s not a bad game by any means, it’s just a weird one that feels really different from the previous game. It doesn’t feel like a sequel, it feels much more like a spinoff. That being said, the ending cliffhanger has me very intrigued. I haven’t played Lightning Returns yet, so maybe it will fill in these gaps/weirdness.

While XIII-2 isn't terrible - in fact the gameplay itself is vastly improved over XIII - it retcons the ending of XIII using time travel and alternate timelines, and ends on a sour note to justify the existence of the third game: Lightning Returns. If you really need to know how the story continues, you'll be better off watching condensed playthroughs on youtube of XIII-2 and Lightning Returns.

The other comments mentioning the game crashing are not wrong. Luckily there are easy fixes out there if you google ffxiii 2 patch and ffxiii 2 crash fix.

The frame rate constantly drops to almost nothing and then the game crashes. I tried it on both windows and linux with the Steam Deck. Even with the fixes I mentioned above, it still wouldn't run well enough to play.Regardless of all that, I love this game because of the fact that you are going on an adventure traveling through time. There aren't many games out there that have time traveling in them as part of the main plot and not many that get it right when they do.

True Path,23.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053284337/,"August 26, 2023",0,"All in all it is a step up from the previous game. It still has the paradigm system and technically less characters, but that you only ever got to use three at a time anyway. Encountering enemies is generally better for getting pre-emptive attacks. I would have preferred that they didn’t just spawn out of nowhere, but the landing the attack to start combat is nice. Also going through different areas at different times an unlocking the respective areas was actually fun.The story is mostly a mess. It starts off confusingly and remains largely detached from the previous game save for it's characters. It also puts in a lot of arbitrary fancy names for things that actually makes the situation worse. The realm inbetween time is the Historia Crux, but this knowledge is passed to you by someone who doesn't really know anything about it. The story had some neat concepts some enjoyable character developments occurred with some touching emotional pieces, but it felt disjointed and separate. A primary example is NOEL KREISS himself, his character is somehow all over the place, mysterious (cause lack of content) and boring all at the same time, yet at some point you can identify with him. With the new characters that were introduced, it really just felt like I played an elaborate filler of the last game. I wouldn't be surprised if someone with a good idea wrote half of the story and then the rest was poorly filled in by the B Team.The game maintains its visual style. Some designs I was not too much of a fan of, but they did allow for costume changes which fixed a lot for me. The environments are what really shine here, especially the Academy. Also NOEL KREISS himself had a very nice move set which kept combat engaging.The sound was a very mixed bag. The voice actors did a good job on their part and kept each character alive, however due to some of the lines, it just stood out as cringe. They put an over-reliance on those proper names and sometimes that just sticks out in the audio and reminding me this is a poorly written story. What goes in concert with that is some of the music choice. Much like my story comment, some of the B team just randomly threw songs at this that just didn’t fit, while using some previous music which was tried and true and some well placed bangers.  It left me feeling confused but mostly cot content with the audio. The default combat music was 100% terrible though.Overall the game was fun to a point, but I could not recommend that someone else plays it unless they REALLY like final fantasy and specifically 13. It'll be entertaining, but if you have other options, your time is better spent there. The time travel both made me really want to like the game, and also nearly pass out from how hard my eyes rolled. Where Final Fantasy 13 had me excited to see where the next part of the series takes me, this one left me just wanting to finish it quickly or skip it entirely given the overall rating of the game.",Not Recommended,

From graphical glitches that caused problems with the MSAA to a weird sound bug caused by surround sound that caused that game to have a loud buzzing noise. To call the early impressions of this game a chore, would be an understatement. While all of these issues can be resolved, it is important to talk about them none the less and should be a consideration when making you purchase decision.Now with that out of the way, FFXIII-2 is a fantastic entry in the Final Fantasy franchise. It seem like everything they established in the first game was polished and improved for this entry. The Paradigm system is back and now allows for the Team Leader to be changed upon death, it also allows the player to recruit monsters to act as the third party member ala Pokemon. The crystarium has been simplified, streamlined and it no longer takes ages for the player to upgrade their character. The story has a new cast of characters that fit in nicely with the old cast. The story also features a cool time travel mechanic that allows the player to jump to any point in the time line and see how their actions a have affected the world and characters. This game improved so much from the first entry that it is genuinely one of my favorites of the franchise, i finished the 27 hour campaign over the course of 3 sittings as i found it hard to put down, and while it may not be perfect, i find it hard to pick out anything to really criticize about it.

XyoCL,28.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/XyoCL/,"April 11, 2023",0,"Regardless of how I feel about the actual game, I can't recommend this with how much of a mess the PC port is.  Some mix of FF13 fix, music fixes, rain effect fixes, and running in Windows Vista compatibility mode being required.For the actual game it's a mix of things that are neat and interesting and things that are just frustrating. Story: Well I hope you read the novel that released after the game came out that explains how you get to 13-2 from 13, because it's quite a jump. Overall the story is neat but not without dumb moments. Combat and Progression: It's 13's combat again. If you liked that, well here is more of it but with new limitations. Now for your 3rd party member you get to use monsters you tame but only up to 3 of them can be included in a set of Paradigms so that limits what your build options are. Leveling is largely similar with levels split between jobs but instead of the larger crystarium it's a clear ""1 level of Commando please"" interface. There is a fair bit of room to dig into monster customization but I did not.Gameplay: Why did they add in random encounters? Ok they almost certainly did it for time reasons and to make grinding clearer but it's a nuisance and jarring after 13's system of just running into enemies in the overworld. The jumping and platforming added are largely fine until the end. Overall things are fine difficulty wise until the last boss which is a wildly large jump.Music : The music director for this game did a great job at just picking some wild choices and I'm here for it. The musical choices are just bizarre but other than one really annoying piano track at the end it's good but not at all what you think of when you think of ""Final Fantasy music"". Overall, FF13-2 definitely had segments that got me real grumpy but overall it's an interesting time if you can manage to get through the myriad of technical issues.",Not Recommended,

Cat With a Gat,22.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CatTechSupport/,"February 27, 2023",0,"This is the one review I will make: for a good reason.Overall I enjoy the Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy trilogy, excluding Type Zero only connected via the world of Nova Chrysalia. The story is good if you the world of Nova Crystallis is enjoyable to you, from the plot points of Snow becoming a L'Cie again, all the way to Hope becoming a director for the Academy, BUT THIS IS WHY I THE REVIEW. The story is good if you enjoy the Nova Crystallis world that Final Fantasy has but the game play is beyond painful: to make a short list- Certain aspects of the Paradigm system are just straight up removed from both playable characters and all monsters you can obtain as the third party member: want to cast haste? WELL NOPE NOT ALLOWED UNLESS YOU FARM FOR ITEMS TO LEVEL YOU MONSTERS SO YOU CAN UNLOCK AUTO-HASTE! It is the same with other spells as well and this process can take hours to just get the materials for a single grid of Crystarium system for a monster to get to level 99 in some cases if you want to Bonus Crystarium Points ability because there is no growth egg item.- Monsters that you obtain as the third party member must be leveled up through items obtained in combat, thing is the datalog is just as confusing to navigate if you find a monster that drops a specific item/items.- Your equipment is locked to a set number points meaning you can only have a set number of points allocated to equipment and each thing of equipment has a base total of at minimum 25 and at max 100, your maximum total of points you can have is 100 after a few levels of your Crystarium system.- The amount of points the Crystarium system requires to level this time around is grows in additive nature meaning you can start with low numbers but after two or three level through you are paying up to 500+ to a single node that does the total back to base even if you are starting on a class such as Commander being level 65 and medic being level 1, you are still paying over 500+ points for a node in medic even if it is level 1.- There are fights that no matter what you do just seem unfair to the point that the rate you can do things to the rate monsters can do things is just insane. Some combats monsters are able to act two or three times before you can act once due to being stagger locked out of being able to use your attacks.Even with the story if you enjoy the entire line of games Final Fantasy 13/Type 0 have to offer but I cannot recommend this because it is just painful to play. If you want to play a Final Fantasy 13 game I recommend the first one because of these issues. I can find most games enjoyable even if something is super flawed, but this is painful on the hands and headache inducing to play.",Not Recommended,

There is a hump with this game, it's somewhere in the middle where it's hard to know where to go sometimes, a guide definitely helps over just wandering around for hours (like I did), I actually wandered so much that I became over leveled, but I think that's mainly my fault. The story is okay, the characters are okay, the gameplay is fine. The music is actually really good!

Damienziegfried,49.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/damienziegfried/,"January 26, 2023",0,"There are similar technical hurdles to make all ff 13 games launch and play correctly. But if you get passed those and the game will play, it's fantastic!  This takes the gameplay of the first FF 13 game and makes it non-linear.  You also get to have a beast summon which functions far better than anything in previous FF titles' summons in that it works with the party instead of for it. This game is a must for completionists as well. You will find yourself easily chasing down all of the fragments to get the secret ending. It's less of a find all treasures vibe and more of the story goes until the end vibe. Which was nice. Many games just want you to collect 160 of something and then come back. Not here really.As far as getting the game to launch, FF 13 titles have a series of issues that can be fixed easily with ""FF13fix"" on GitHub. More or less copy 2 files and it works. Try this first if having issues. There is a second version of ""FF13Fix"" that involves the file to fix the buzzing sound for anything not stereo. You will know if you have this issue at launch. I sure did lol.With all of the issues regarding getting the game to launch, I hope they update this one day. I mean the red and blue ""Crazy Chocobo"" is a good enough reason on it's own to buy and play this game.It's an angry, agro, moshing and headbanging choco that eats all of your greens while nu/death metal chocobo theme music plays and you ride around. It also runs from you when you want to get back on. lolAll things considered, it's a wonderful game in hindsight. Also, most of the team(s) that brought this game to PC were contracted. The reason these errors persist in running FF 13 1/2/3 and FF 12 was because they were contracted to make the game work on PC and it was completed right before massive changes to how graphics cards work. As such, no one was around to rework a patch or redo chunks of the game. Shockingly, a workaround can be found on GitHub that is like 2 files. But, it explains why we do not have updates as simple as this as they are no longer working on that project. This speaks more about Square Enix's contract based working practices and how they do things than i does the dev team that brought this to PC.I hope this review will resolve a lot of the long standing questions involved with this series and the community.

Xionic,3.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/XionicAihara/,"December 28, 2022",0,"Performance issues kill this game altogether. From stutters in cutscenes to constant crashes even with the fixes. Experienced 3 crashes within 30mins of each other and replaying the same content over and over just was not worth the time investment. The game runs don't get me wrong, but you play roulette with the crashes. Save often as autosave is very infrequent.From what I remember playing this back on 360, the story was, and still is convoluted. It is very hard to write a cohesive time travel story and keep people engaged. The story is good, it just feels all over the place at times. FF13 series just feels like the odd one out in the franchise, fans either love or hate the series.The game opens up fantastically in typical Final Fantasy fashion. Different combat system from the first game and added QTEs that don't hinder gameplay too much and feels fun to do unlike some games (quantic). The music in this game is really good as well, as with most Final Fantasy games. The combat and overworld soundtracks are just pleasing to listen to. There are no sound settings so the game will most likely start out loud and you'll need to turn it down in your system settings.Overall, if you can get the game to run decently and not crash on you, its a win and might as well play and enjoy the ride. But for most people, you'll probably run into more problems then it's worth for the time investment. Total crashes by the time I got to 005AF = 8 :(",Not Recommended,

The story is sort of messy (because time travel duh) but still good enough to motivate me to finish it. Plus it links to the original FFXIII which adds some extra emotional weight if you played that one. I enjoyed the monster collecting part too, since it adds so much variety to your 3rd party member. The post game content is also pretty massive. With all the DLC and super bosses it ends up feeling more massive and fun than FFXIII. Another thing to mention is that the music in this game is top tier. Most tracks are memorable and really unique. A few missteps but overall a really great score that in my opinion surpasses the original FFXIII. There are some issues with the audio mix though. I believe there are mods to address that. The port itself is basically the most low effort it could be. I had to use a few mods to get it running optimally, but after that it was smooth. This shouldn't be necessary.

Dragon age origins Suffer from this as well requiring a patch to turn the Virtual memory into 4GB This isn't the Fault of the Port team Because at the time the standard was  4gbs. That being said A lot of the other issues are. for example, Xbox controller buttons are miss colored and the ps3 controller schemes were never ported. All of the DLC is missing and was never ported. The rain in Certain levels is Broken and was next patched. All issues that shouldn't exist  But do. But thanks to the fans it has been fixed and functions Perfectly. Dont go by the Negative reviews. The game does have issues and its plainly but that does'nt make the game Bad in any way.

Qelris,44.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/qelris/,"July 12, 2022",0,"Unfortunately, this game deserves a negative review even after just 5 minutes into the game. For some reason, the game's Virtual Memory is capped at 2gb and every time it goes above, it will just end up crashing the game. That said, with a little bit of tinkering, you can get the game running perfectly. (I used: The story feels a bit worst than its prequel, but I still found it enjoyable. I think it's mostly due to the story arc that it covers.The same combat system that was present in XIII is back with a slight improvement. This time around, if your party leader dies, you're not doomed. However, that doesn't change the fact that while it isn't your standard generic/boring turn-based combat system, it still manage to feel as bad, if not worst, as it gets old and boring quickly. 99% of the time will just be you repeatitively using Auto-chain, unless it's a boss, then you might need to think a bit more. The normal fights just don't feel worth, yet you still need to do them if you want to become stronger. Also, why is there so few ways to obtain Mana Crystals? Going for magic late game just feels like you're handicapping yourself, better to just use physical.The soundtracks.. what the hell even happened there? It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most tracks don't feel like they match the moments and none of them are memorable. I spent over 30 hours on this game and I cannot remember any of the musics in it, beside that terrible boss music with the screams. I went back to FFXIII a few weeks ago to finish the achievements I hadn't done and I was vibing with the music. I just can't here.With all of that said, I still enjoyed the game to an extent. If you want to experience the game for yourself, I'd still recommend it, but if you value your time heavily or have a low amount of spare time, then this is probably a title that you can skip. If skipping is the option that you decide, and that you are interested in the sequel (FFXIII Lightning Returns), then I'd suggest at least spending 7 minutes to watch the story summary by Elligible Monster on Youtube, titled ""Complete Story - Final Fantasy XIII-2"".",Not Recommended,

I had 3 crashes in less than 15 min of game play before I even got control of the character. HOWEVER* There are a lot of documented fixes out there. For me, it was as simple as downloading the ""4gb_patch"" which patches the executable to run with 4gb of ram rather than 2gb, and now over 7 hours in I have had zero crashes. Other fixes are as simple as disabling cloud saving. This is by no means a guarantee that it will fix for everyone, so I recommend installing and running right away, if you crash, implement a few fixes, and if you still crash get a refund (if you can download/install fast enough).

Time mechanics could've made for more interesting puzzles (and the time rifts get tedious) but they're still fun.Musically it's mostly FF13, just with a few new tracks.Gameplay take the FF13 gameplay loop, tighten & fix it so that it's more intuitive and faster, make the crystarium make more sense, and you end up with a decent battle system.And then there's monster recruitment and infusion. And that's when the rabbit hole REALLY shows. You can recruit *every* non-boss non-twisted-human monster in the game, each fitting one of the 6 classes with some permanent passives/abilities...and slots to have up to 10 total. And ability to learn and inherit skills by the same way you fill passives - infusing other monsters. The net result is you could make a LOT monsters in the game work in your team if you so desire and it ends up being fun figuring out how to build and optimize the party for late and post-game challenges.Also Chocobo Racing is back and much deeper than it was in FF7 which automatically makes this recommended.",Recommended,

However, XIII-2 does a great job of just being a fun experience despite its narrative shortcomings.  As the second game in the trilogy, Square basically took everything that was good about XIII-1 and fixed a lot of problems that people had with the first game.  There is no unnecessary padding when it comes to combat being fun.  Monster collecting is also rewarding and offers a lot of customization to combat setups.  Side quests are almost immediately present and exploration is encouraged.  The game is short but sweet (unlike XIII-1) with lots of side content available if you want to seek it out.  Music takes great tracks from XIII-1 and adds in some new bangers.  Environments range from beautiful to a bit unnerving with creepy time space distortion sections.  My main criticisms are the general plot of the game and the characters.  The plot is a time travel plot that throws almost all of XIII-1's story out the window in a comical way.  Time travel plots are okay at best and absolute incoherent messes at worse.  XIII-2 is in the okay-ish range with some questionable moments thrown in for no reason.  Still more enjoyable than XIII-1's plot.  The main characters Noel, Serah, and Caius are interesting characters that unfortunately don't get completely fleshed out by the end of the main story.  It feels like we are just getting to know them before their screen time is up.  I do like them but feel as the 3 were a bit of a missed opportunity.  Overall, very good game would prefer this game to XIII-1 any day.  Maybe one day I'll try Lightning Returns but we shall see.

Looks good, is fun enough to have a pleasant experience with, writing (not plot, but *writing*) is better than it needs to be. I'd give this a 6.5/10; above par, but nothing I would consider an absolute must-play. Only problem is that it tends to crash at certain transitions (from area to area, going into a battle, coming out of a battle, etc). Thanks to the rather generous Auto Save, this rarely becomes an issue worthy of note, but it IS kind of annoying. Also, the tutorial can be kind of boring, but I believe that's true of most tutorials, so I don't hold it against the game.Edit: I am not a Final Fantasy fan by any stretch of the imagination. I have never played any other FF games and I have only a very cursory knowledge of the lore of the general series. This, inevitably, has affected my judgement and my rating.

Personally I also enjoyed the concept of travelling through time, visiting different locations and seeing how they change and collecting different monsters, which can be used as party member.The only downside is that the PC port of the game sadly doesn't run very well and fps drops can't be avoided no matter how good your PC is (at least not without mods).",Recommended,

YuFish,84.1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YuFish/,"October 29, 2021",0,"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is definitely an improvement over the first game, but knowing how Square Enix is, it's still riddled with technical issues mostly resulting from a bad port of the game. As usual, the game runs poorly - capping in at 30FPS no matter what the Store Page says about 60FPS possibilities - low bitrate audio, crisp FMVs due to compression for some reason, and the game only using 2GB of RAM like the first game. And, of course, the same author who compiled a bunch of fixes for the first game has also written a Steam Guide on how to enhance FFXIII-2 so go check it out. As usual, it contains performance fixes, crash fixes, and the ""modernization"" of the game although this time, the HD textures are a lot more subtle than the first game. There's also a mod that restores past DLCs that Square Enix removed due to licensing issues which is pretty nice.The improvements come from the overall gameplay; from redesigned drop tables and how the game calculates monster drops, to tiny optimizations in the battle system. The crystarium is also not as linear as it was in the first game, but they went a bit overboard as it's almost impossible to understand how the thing works without looking up a guide, and advancing through the crystarium willy-nilly will result with you having a weaker party and may make the game quite more difficult than it should be in the late game.Traversing the game world isn't as linear as the first game as well. Unlike FFXIII where you just follow a predetermined path up until the third to the last chapter (which goes back again to being linear a couple of chapters later), FFXIII-2 offers players the freedom to explore any place they want at any time (emphasis on ) which makes for a very modular, non-linear way of playing the game. Of course, some places have higher-levelled enemies than the others which would indirectly guide you back to where the game wants you to be, but it isn't as spoon-fed as the first game and, if you persevere enough, even places blocked by the sheer level of enemies are still doable.The biggest change, in my opinion, is the introduction of . It's basically like Pokemon where you capture a monster that you fight and have it battle for you. In FFXIII-2, instead of a 3rd human party member, you will be utilizing the powers of monsters - each monster specializing in their own role, and one role only. Unlike in FFXIII where you can pretty much choose from any role at any time, FFXIII-2 limits that by making your third party member be of limited roles. You can only have up to three third roles that you can switch between.Gil is not a notable issue anymore in the game. You still need a hefty amount of it when you're building your monsters, but unlike the first game, you can easily amass Gil as you play through the story. In my experience, I had amassed over 150 thousand Gil just from clearing 3 chapters, and no items are ridiculously expensive in the shop which is really nice as well. No more 2 Million Gil material that you will only use once and you have to get another one way or another.CP, just like in the previous game, can be acquired as you play the game and you almost don't need to grind for it. Or at least, don't directly grind - because capturing monsters isn't as simple as it seems and you will probably need to fight a lot of enemies to find really good monsters to add to your party which, in turn, will make you amass a lot of CP before you even realize it. You can easily be underlevelled in this game, but it's as easy to be overlevelled as well. That's because the Crystarium stages aren't locked behind story progression so if you have so much free time in your life and perseverance, you can upgrade both characters' Crystarium to the latest stage even during the early game. Another thing that I liked about this game: Square removed the tedious way of levelling and upgrading weapons and accessories. You can now just buy weapons to replace your current ones, and the shop will even offer you the upgraded version of the weapons in exchange for Gil and materials that are relatively easy to acquire (compared to Traps and Dark Matter; which means pretty cheap too) and most of them come from enemies that are relatively easy to kill (compared to toises and long guis). Of course, there's still materials that can only be acquired from rare-spawning enemies and the material itself is a rare drop from said enemies, but the game introduces a new feature called  to help you with the grind.One of the key objectives in the game is to collect ""Fragments"". I won't be diving into what these are, but if you collect enough of these, you can talk to an NPC that will give you  depending on how far you are in the game and how many Fragments you have collected so far. These Fragment Skills range from little adjustments like being able to move the camera during cutscenes, to insane game-altering effects like making rare enemies to spawn more often, or increase the amount of enemies that you can encounter. Each of this Fragment Skill has their own use and you can tweak them any time you want. Beating the game will also give you a Fragment Skill to see other endings that you normally couldn't get, which adds more to the non-linearity of the game.I think this is what really separates FFXIII-2 from its predecessor. FFXIII practically has no post-game content; once you beat the game, it's pretty much the end. Of course you can fill out all the characters' crystarium to their maximum level after beating the game, but there's not much to it. The Ci'eth Stone missions that you have to do after beating the game is only that way because you are virtually limited by your characters' stats that are locked behind the Stage 10 Crystarium that can only be unlocked after beating the game. But technically speaking, you can do all Ci'eth Stone missions even before the final boss, thus technically making post-game content non-existent. I really feel that FFXIII had a DLC that never came to be since all post-game content is all about making your characters even stronger, but that's a topic for another day.In FFXIII-2, you get the alternate endings called  after you beat the game, and there are a handful of them to go through. The game also has actual DLCs to play through after beating the game which I think FFXIII is really lacking (like I mentioned earlier), and it will take you hours to finish all of them. The DLC even includes literally a Coliseum where you can fight a bunch of enemies to test your skills and the monsters that you have built throughout the game. Unlike FFXIII where the only post-game you can do are the Ci'eth Stone missions that you can actually do before beating the game, FFXIII-2 actually offers content that you can only do after beating it.Like I said, I grinded for materials and monsters in the game so you can pretty much shave of 5 to 7 hours off of the recorded playtime in this review. I am also writing this review before doing post-game so expect the playtime hours to jump to, I don't know, I guess maybe 8 to 10 hours more. I am still not finished building my monsters and I have yet to begin viewing the Paradox Endings, let alone the DLCs and stuffs. However, as much as I like this game, and being the cheapskate that I am, I still recommend buying this game on sale. It's a pretty old game (especially if you count the years from its initial release on the PS3) and spending almost 10 bucks to play it with technical issues that Square could have easily fixed, but didn't, isn't really worth it. But I really recommend playing this game especially if you liked the first game.",Recommended,

The game also removes the horrible first paradigm switch's long animation vastly improving the flow of combat. The change to have sentinel be a passive damage reduction adds a lot to the gamplay when combined with fast paradigm switching as well. They also finally added high level ass-saving spells like ultima and meteor through class bonus's.One issue I had with the gameplay though a minor one given as the game isn't as difficult as XIII is that getting a preemptive strike no longer gives 99% stagger making it more or less pointless.The soundtrack is also probably my favourite in the franchise, There are songs from other Final Fantasy titles that I like more than anything in XIII-2 but the level of quality it showcases is incredible and is even better than XIII, I love that they included drastically more vocals in the music in general.Now the story I just thought was good, nothing special here, again I do not like time travel plots so the fact that I'm not hating on the games story speaks volumes; The problem however is that this title has the worst ending in the entire franchise as far as i'm concerned. The entire thing happens just so they can set up XIII-3 so it's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ show all-round. I do not think it's appropriate for the game to end without wrapping things up like it does as all Final Fantasy games are and should always be their own complete packages, regardless of ""-2"" status; This was a complete ♥♥♥♥ up. So yeah I recommend the game, It's a decent Final Fantasy title with a good story and pretty damn good gameplay all things considered, Just expect the ending to not ""end"" anything . Case in point make sure you buy XIII-2 and XIII-3 together.the switch to somewhat non-linear levels was done fantastically and I also think this game doesn't overstay its welcome at all like XIII did. whereas I got deathly bored by the end of XIII I was doing perfectly fine by the end of XIII-2.Oh and it is completely unacceptable how poor performance is in this game, I just sucked it up and got used to 30fps on average and that's WITH several mods installed to fix the game; and with settings changed in nvidia control panel to increase performance.",Recommended,

I'd actually recommend giving this game a try if you enjoy Final Fantasy, Doctor Who, and/or Chrono Trigger. Feels more like a real Final Fantasy game, since there are enjoyable side quests, NPCs to interact with, choices to make, areas worth exploring and revisiting, and an interesting story that is actually fun to learn about as you progress. Also offers a fair bit more customization of character development than a lot of Final Fantasy games - Crystarium allows you to focus completely on the job classes you want in this game (unlike in FF13 which locked the crystarium progression until linear story milestones, forcing you to spread your CP to jobs you don't use just to boost stats to survive the tedious battles). Speaking of battles, FF13-2 actually has enjoyable battles - you still have stagger system, but it doesn't take 3 hour to stagger a random enemy in this game - most battles can be won in a reasonable amount of time even in the end game section. Easy mode was a bit too easy, so feel confident in going with Normal mode on your first play if you're used to other Final Fantasy games. This isn't FF13. This is fun.",Recommended,

All I can say is getting 100 consecutive pre-emtive strikes, filling out the entire beastiary, and stupid slot machine and chocobo racing mini-games are the worst achievements. Let's preface this by saying my game kept crashing until I added about 4 small mods to make it work. After that I had no problem. While it's dumb SquareEnix can't fix their own game, the fact that easy fixes exist will let me overlook that fact.Overall it's a good game. Some minor changes from FF13 include cutting out the time-wasting paradigm shift cinematic, monsters pop up randomly as you run around like older FF titles instead of being a feature of the landscape, the entire shop / weapons progression system is effectively removed, and levels are not linear but instead being very back-and-forthy. Big changes include the whole time-travel mechanic for the story and the pokemon-like monster system for your 3rd party member. I generally dislike time-travel stories because no matter how consistent a story tries to be with the rules inevitably there is some plot hole or paradox that I just can't accept. Square Enix seems to have found an ingenious solution to that problem by just having the entire system not really make any sense to begin with so my ""that-makes-no-sense-o-meter"" just breaks and somehow I end up just accepting everything. Sure, you can totally just 'shout so loudly that somebody in the past hears you and changes the future.' It actually wasn't that hard to just go with it and have a good story of it as long as you didn't try to think too much about it. I still definitely think FF13's story was better, but it was nice meeting Serah and Noel and seeing how the world progresses over about 700 years. There's actually quite a lot of interesting lore to learn about the universe so I liked that. But the monster-collecting thing? I hated that. I hated it in FF10-2 and I hate it here. And the entire weapons progression thing from FF13 is replaced by collecting components to upgrade monsters then feeding monsters to other monsters so they can learn their abilities. You can get some pretty OP combos if you're willing to grind, but thankfully you can play the whole game without really bothering with it and I was so happy when I could do the DLC content and have Lightning in my party again (she was actually stronger than my max-level characters). Let's talk about characters. In FF13 I loved the group and having the story split them up and seeing their interactions with other members, etc. Here you only have Serah and Noel. With only two characters you can have less of a dynamic. Some don't like Serah because she doesn't really have much character, but I liked her enough. I was surprised by how much I liked Noel, though. He was much better, from a character motivation point of view. As for the main villain, some seem to really like him and see where he is coming from. I disagree, I think his entire motivation is stupid. I much preferred the Fal'cie from FF13. TL;DR - Its a good, fun game, but nothing to write home about. I loved FF13 and it doesn't 'ruin' that for me like I feared it would.

Atom,64.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mratomrabbit/,"August 4, 2021",0,"Bad port of a pretty/very good JRPG depending on your tastes and what you find appealing. You'll probably at least get console level performance at higher and arbitrary resolutions if you cap to 30, uncapped you'll likely get severe fps drops when loading new areas of maps, and might experience generally lower fps in crowded parts of the game too. You will really want to use the FF13Fix mod as well as the 4GB or Large Address Aware patches -- check PCGW. Despite all this I more or less 100%'d the game. Nowhere was ever unplayably bad, and my CPU isn't too great compared to stuff from the last year or so that I hear gets a fair improvement in performance. I will say on the whole performance is substantially worse than XIII though.With regard to the game itself, it's a zany time travelling adventure with a veritable bevy of side content in the form of minigames, collectibles, extra unlockable abilities and game modifiers (more money, encounters, alternative hidden endings etc.), a really cool villain with a big sword and some great DLC boss fights, albeit gated effectively behind near 100% completion due to how difficult some of them are. Graphics: Very nice for a console title from early 2010s. Character models look great, environmental art is stunning at times, as it was in the original 13, with some locations being visually striking and extremely imaginative. Some lower res textures here and there. There are a handful of graphical mods also available. Monster designs are frequently reused from 13 and continue to look great.Music and sound: Just great all around. Very large diversity in genres, some really top-tier JRPG boss themes. Voice acting is solid, in both English and Japanese, but the voice volume is a little low in some cutscenes. There are mods that address this. Gameplay: The core battle system is basically refined from the original 13. You have two party members you can swap control of freely, versus the original 1 at a time, while the third party member you can assign from a pool of monsters you can recruit -- Monster recruitment is its own sub system, including leveling paths, learning skills and transferring skills to new monsters to make super powerful party members. The ATB system works basically the same as in 13, except the usage feels snappier and more fluid, with much less of a delay on Paradigm changes. The combat system is really exceptional, and makes me sad that it will probably never return in future FF entries. I'd recommend checking out at overview of the system, but at its strongest it can feel exceptionally dynamic and reactive, with you having to constantly learn enemy attack patterns and how to respond on the fly given what monsters you have, how much damage you need to deal in a fixed time, etc. Really good stuff.The other big facet of gameplay is exploration, which is far less linear than 13 almost to a fault. It can often feel overwhelming with how many possible areas you can explore at any given time, leading to hidden enemies, bosses, sidequests. All these things also reward you with additional story scenes, some more context into what life is like after the end of 13, and datalog entries which really flesh out characters and lore more. Exploration will also reveal minigames (including races, poker, slot machines etc.), (included) DLC secret episodes, superbosses. It feels like the game is more side content than main game, so if that is something you really like in your JRPG you'll probably dig it here.Story and Characters: The story is needlessly convoluted and retcons the ending to a game which ending more or less conclusively. Shortly after 13's ending, everyone becomes convinced that Lightning disappeared, and then time travel shenanigans start to happen and Lightning's sister Serah and a time traveler called Noel team up to solve these problems. The balance is probably the opposite to 13, which had arguably dislikable characters situated in a world and mythos that were extremely interesting. In 13-2, the story is held up by character interactions and a villain who is really compelling despite a story that sort of starts and ends in the same place.Overall probably a 6/10 story mixed in with 8/10 characters, 8/10 exploration, 9/10 battle system, 9/10 music, 8/10 visual design. A really nice experience for fans of 13. Just be aware of the port issues and how to mitigate them.",Recommended,

There are more places, areas to explore than before. A more free form exploration than the first game. The combat is faster. Although there are some omitted parts which are kinda a downside.Unlike the first game, the party consists of the monsters you collected while adventuring. Kinda like a pokemon kinda way. These monster will act as the third person of your two main-character party. It's kinda tacked on, not giving any reason lorewise why we can't just have other characters as third ones instead. The other downside for me is the story. This is maybe due to the somewhat mediocre voice direction, but I don't really pay attention to that. The story is about Serah, one of the core characters from the first game, wanting to find her sister after she was erased from time due to a paradox invasion. Then she joins a time traveller, Noell, in a quest to save the timeline from being destroyed.A story about time travel can be easily be a miss for some people, and can get very convoluted very easily. This is a miss for maybe due to not having enough investment and information on this fantasy world. Because most of the story goes on to travelling each places from the first game adn solving a paradox happening there. It got better in the end when some character moments starts to shine like Noell and the antagonist. After the story ended, it lead to more questions than answers, which I was kinda dissatisfied. Although again, this is maybe due to the lack execution in its world building.The soundtrack, world, and character designs are gorgeous. But overall, the gameplay really balances out the bad.

Instructions to install them are available in a guide.FF13-2 surpasses FF13 in virtually every aspect of the gameplay mechanics department. FF13 players begin this game in New Bodhum 003AF and can can't help but immediately notice that the game developers have fixed one critical problem in the original, by making the game open world from the start. Characters are not just enemies who should be killed, but real people with real dialogue. You're likely to feel genuine empathy with the scientists, Guardian corps. soldiers, other NPCs in the game. The way the music changes with enemy encounters, the way the NPCs react whenever the protagonists sit atop a Chocobo or find a hidden treasure, gives a feel of liveliness in the game, something lacking in FF13. The dialogues in FF13 seemed mostly cringe to me, while those of FF13-2 seem extremely realistic. One of my favourite things in the game is the realistic way it portrays scientists. No need of dealing gameplay progress in order to farm monster materials at a specific location, like in FF13. You can now easily 'teleport' to other areas of the game via the Historia Crux.One more good thing with the Steam port is that the graphics are in 1080p. You can clearly see Serah's abs in the beach outfit. Even Lightning (as a DLC secondary party character) looks like the actual lightning as can only be seen in the pre-rendered cut scenes of FF13.CONS:Ridiculous monster spawn rate in August Tower 200AF. Some locations such as Oerba 400AF have too many puzzle to solve, which becomes extremely monotonous.

This is still one of my top games of all time because of the gameplay. The battle system is fun af. Don't focus on the fact that it says ""auto-battle"" - it's only like that because the battles are so fast-paced. The XIII battle system needs you to focus on the strategic aspects of what roles you need in the moment, and you have to shift your paradigms according to that. XIII-2 perfects this by speeding up the ATB Gauge a bit, lets you switch between party leaders, and lets you catch monsters to pick your 3rd party member. I won't go into more detail, but just don't discount this game just because people say ""it plays itself with auto-battle"". The world is actually quite nice. It's nowhere near the FInal Hallway 13 that the first game has a reputation for. Each timeline you visit is basically a self contained world, which all vary in their openness.

Kiro,33.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kiro47/,"July 9, 2021",0,"It's definitely a fairly unstable game with a number of issues that cause graphical lag and random crashes some of which even cause Steam to freeze and crash as well.  The community patches help a little bit (installed after 3-4 hours of dealing with many crashes), but is far from a proper fix.It's unfortunately not just an issue of people not having good enough PC's either.  I played the game at 1440p with 4k shadow resolution and 8x dlss.  With a window open monitoring resource usage, I found that GPU usage and memory both usually sat around 33% usage and bouncing around a bit of course, with CPU never going above 35%, memory around 4G.  I actually found that switching to 16x dlss actually caused more issues, while GPU usage topped at around 60% the game significantly dropped to a laggy frame rate and I also had issues with audio falling out of sync and clipping out as well interestingly enough.  Anyways, enough of that and to the actual game.So we get hit away with the same combat system as FF 13 which is perfectly fine given that it is a sequel and whatnot.  The keyboard controls weren't exactly conveniently mapped, so using a controller is much more pleasant.  However, I did find that this game suffered from the same ""issue"" that FF 13 also had.  Which is that I can more or less beat every battle minus a handful of boss battles by just defaulting to Relentless Assault (COM + 2x RAV), occassionally switching to Diversity (COM + RAV + MED) for harder fights.  In all the older FF games I can't really think of any where this really happens and to me it just takes out a piece of fun of the game.  Even FF X-2 which had a similar combat system didn't really seem this obscenely easy.  I honestly found myself just spam clicking A on the controller while browsing my phone in the midst of most of the battles I got into, just zero attention required and still found myself getting 5 star ratings most of the time.  I almost wonder if the game would be better off without auto-battle just to promote more interactivity.  Another minor annoyance I found at higher levels is your spell list is a two column list that can't fit all the spells for a class at once on it (mainly for RAV).  I wish they expanded that to be a 3 column+ or expand more on the screen just so I could see everything I had available at once since it's an active combat system.  In turn based combat of older FF games that wasn't really required since you had all the time in the world to decide what to do.  I also found myself annoyed with the insane reuse and retexturing of all assets.  I absolutely expected it to some extent of course, but jeez it feels like a bit much.  One map was used 4x over with different lighting, and a few others used 3x over, the Steppe at least was managable for it's credit and I did love Academia for the most part.  But I really expected at least a few models for weapons, at the very least for the Chaos weapons, but no. Just another recolor on top of the base model, not even an interesting texture applied to it.Also I'll note I haven't played FF 13-3 (Lightning Returns) yet either. Overall, I wanted to enjoy the game, but between the: bugs, inconsistencies, cliches, over-reuse, and the blandness of battle I just honestly spent a fair bit of the time playing wishing I was onto the next piece of the story already so I could finish it.",Not Recommended,

A lot of repetitiveness, going back and forward constantly and awfully easy to lose track of what you're doing, get lost in side quests or even break the story line if you aren't careful.

Symarian,59.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Symarian/,"June 6, 2021",0,"TL;DR : Its a decent game, but not for most folks.The Maps are repetitive in some kind, because you re-visit the same area over and over, just in different times. So basically, you travel to sort-of-the-same-area, but in different eras (like 05 years after 13, Bresha Ruins, then also Bresha 100 after Fall, Bresha 300 after Fall) Which can be annoying. Long:If you have played and ejoyed FF-13 it is a decent follow up. However, the Paradigm-System can be sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, because you only have 2 Characters + 1 Monster, so the Monsters need to be leveled through Materials instead of CP. The System does not explain it too good, so here is a short: Monsters are sorted in 3 categories, which are Early Peaker (Gains Stats early on, but does go up too high) Well Grown (Gains Stats decently and peaks in middle level (about 45) and Late Bloomer (Does not get Stats early on at all and is useless below certain ""treshholds"" however, later on gets huge stats boosts and also upgrades further, which makes them the best choice for Lategame) In early stages, you should focus on ""Early Peaker"" Monster or Well Grown ones, too get a good value without too much effort. IF you can get into this, the Story is pretty good imho. The time-travel stuff can be sort of annoying, but I liked the game overall. Also, I am a huge fan of FF-13, so maybe its just my thoughts.Overall: If I had to give it a rating from 1-100, I suppose this game is somewhere around 84.

Music choices can be odd but if you are open to new genres of music that should not be a problem. Visuals are great.

Lars Borshka,3.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LarsBorshka/,"May 8, 2021",0,"A sequel to a game most people didn't like, and to no ones surprise, most people didn't like it.The gameplay changes that XIII-2 introduce include restricting the cast to only two characters and a monster slot, leading to what you would think would be a more streamlined leveling system right? Wrong, instead of allowing the characters to level their jobs based on said jobs individual grid ala the previous game, you now follow a pre set leveling path with big and small orbs that dictate the level of stat bonus your character gets depending on which job levels on which size of node. The difference between a horrible choice of levels versus an ""optimal"" damage build set is minimal once you factor in proper team setups and gear, but that begs the question of why is it even in the game at all if it doesn't matter? Because it's a half baked idea just like monster leveling is. Monster leveling also follows this idea of allowing a monster to get stats based on the orb it picks, but it also depends on the kind of random material you use as a catalyst for the monster to earn a level, along with what job that monster is. Oh, and monsters all have arbitrary level caps that mean that starting monsters are effectively just trash you're going to throw away when you find something just a bit later in the game, instead of allowing you to use any monster in the entire game that you're actually allowed to capture and use.The ability to travel through time is horribly pointless as even though it opens up the idea of abusing time paradox's to travel to timelines that otherwise shouldn't exist or have become nonexistent due to said paradox's, it only ever boils down to ""Kill a boss"" or ""put an item here"" sidequest feeling objectives that serve as story progression based roadblocks that could've served a better purpose should the developers bothered to have thought out a real purpose for letting us jump back and forth through time that wasn't to push this awful narrative that winds up being pointless due to the way it is destined to end from the start.Giant wall of text later, XIII-2 is both a slightly better, and significantly worse experience than XIII, and I would never recommend anyone play it for anything other than a couple background songs.Big wall of text later, to no ones surprise,",Not Recommended,

I found and followed the steam community guide by Surihix and have not had any crashes or major performance issues (some minor temporary slow load-ups is about it) so far.Regarding the actual game, it definitely a different direction from the original. There are additional mechanics and much more additional quests, making it much more complicated and varied than the first. I considered myself a master of the paradigm system in the original (few deaths overall), but after dying quite a number of times in the beginning it feels like the developers want to make you question your ability. The story is not as focused as the first, which is something I missed. If you are interested a broad story with many details then it might work you. Overall I'm enjoying the game and can't wait to see how my characters develop over time. Not as addicting like the first but enjoyable nonetheless.

The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you could mess up your characters if you leveled them completely wrong, unlike the original game where your character had a set number of skills and stats they can gain, whereas in FF13-2 if you want the most optimal character you have to follow a very strict guide.

This port is the worst I've ever seen on steam. It is LITERALLY unplayable. Freezes, and crashes are abundant and unavoidable. I have windows 10 and with all the ""fixes"" i'm still crashing every 20 minutes at best. Constantly losing progress makes this game unbearable to play. The game also either cant or wont use cloud saves, and it will crash my steam every time it closes, or it crashes. (There's an easy fix for the steam crashing problem though) But I've never bought or played a game that was this bad. I was really hoping for more, and this is the best we got. Avoid this game on steam at ALL COSTS. If you really wanna play it, buy it for the ps3 or 360; itll be cheaper, and straight up just run better. Absolutely embarrassing.",Not Recommended,

I implemented every single fix offered up on the forum (thank you to you folks for taking the time and effort!) and the playthrough wasn't too bad at all.

However, this port is just unplayable. It seems SE contracted to the lowest bidder, saw the port, played it for 5 minutes, and called it a wrap.Performance-wise, the game is very poorly optimized. Framerate stutters and drops, resolution is limited, input lags, all while only using ~ 30% of GPU.However, what is more concerning is that the game crashes often. At first, my solution was to constantly save (press 0 to save anywhere, which is a nice feature added from the first game). However, this solution does not work, as the act of saving started to crash the game as well. It's unfortunate, since the first game on PC never crashed for me...The only reason to buy and play this game on PC is for nostalgia purposes. If you never played the game before, and want to, you should either get it on console, watch the playthrough video on Youtube, or read the story on the Wikis.

Okay, we get Serah and this new guy Noel, they seem aight.  But i'm about 75% of the way through the game and they're still a bore because there's barely any development between the two. Gameplay wise, it's faithful to the original paradigm system. Tweaking the presets is fun, but it soon devolves into changing between the same 3 paradigms to get through most battles. Collecting monsters into your party like pokemon was a good addition. I'm just not too impressed with where they took the story and the main characters they used.

The entire game was much different than 13, but did open up the world to explore in the beginning of the game instead of waiting until the later parts, and featured a past, present and future type theme that allowed for some side-quests and additional exploration at different times of the game after certain events and altering the past to re-create a different present and future.The combat system was very much the same in the stagger mechanic, but seemed more relaxed than the previous game. As you only had the two characters, you collected monsters that took the place of your third character, and you leveled and improved them through a sill tree. The true beauty was the DLC additions that allowed you to get several characters from the previous game as a monster, but this happens later in the game than I would have hoped. Unlike the previous game, it is way too easy to overlevel in this game.All in all the game was interesting to play, but while some aspects of the game were an improvement, others changes felt worse than the previous game. Its final fantasy, so expect a lot of grinding as always.

If you like collecting then this game will be a good one for you, otherwise just finish the story. if you need a comparison which has overall better gameplay I think FFXIII-1 > FFXIII-2. FXXIII-2 mostly focus on being free on what objective you want to prioritize, rather than being linear they give it a try to make it non-linear gameplay.btw I like the songs its soothing in the ears. the puzzles also quite refreshing to play, easy to hard.(Note: you might need guides at some fragments if you are not a hardcore collector, some of the fragments need to go to different timeline just to get it which make it harder because there is no indicator where you need to go or who you should talk to they just give a hint for the mission).",Recommended,

Thankfully there are plenty of helpful guides for addressing them and the game is playable. Other suggestions include making sure you enable button prompts if you are using a controller cause of the quick time events.As for the game itself, it's less melodramatic and more of a relaxing romp through the established XIII world at your own pace. It's more challenging and you feel more encouraged to experiment with the paradigm shifting with buffing/debuffing rotations than in the last game which I liked.Be forewarned though that there is one level that is GARBAGE and may make you want to rage quit (Academia 400AF), it was the first time I rage quit and broke something cause of how bad it was. Apparently the level designers thought it would be a good idea to have NPCs turn into monsters right next to you just after you finish a fight, and it happened to me 5 times in a row in one spot.

The Dragon Gamer,30.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198798955687/,"August 29, 2020",0,"Alright, this is... quite something. I enjoyed 13-2 immensely, sunk in about 200 hours total on the Xbox 360 version, and fully completed the game on there. That being said... the port is REALLY poorly done. In order to even get the game to a playable FPS, you have to install a fix compatible with both XIII and XIII-2 from github and turn off your Steam Cloud initially. But, once you get past the first chapter or so... it'll be a lot smoother from there on out. That being said, I'd still recommend the game.One part I enjoyed a lot about this game was the diversity of Paradigm Packs over that of XIII. There are so many monsters to collect that can make your life a lot easier if you put a lot of time in getting materials for them to level up and such, especially the DLC characters, which can only go up to Level 13 as opposed to 90 for many other monsters, but hit way harder at a cost of being really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard to get.The story itself could be considered mediocre for a Final Fantasy game, but it does have a lot more to do than XIII, with a lot of endgame bosses to farm and beat, which I do recommend doing for the sake of earning achievements and getting materials for the endgame weapons.Controls feel a tad bit wonky, but it doesn't feel so bad. I'd recommend the use of a controller though just to make it a bit easier and smoother.Graphically, the XIII trilogy always looked good, and still does, even if it isn't on the level of Final Fantasy XV or the newer games, and the movie scenes - they still look great to this day.Character wise... I do like it a lot. Serah can feel a tad bit bland at times, but she does develop as the story goes on, and Noel is a great addition who adds a good bit of depth; Caius is an interesting antagonist, albeit not a favorite of mine from the series, and it's also nice to see that Lightning has developed quite a lot since XIII, and feels a lot more personable and as such, likable.Soundtrack is overall good, but a few songs(such as Limit Break! and Crazy Chocobo) are just flat out memes. Other ones (such as Caius's Theme and Threat Level Omega) are honestly really good to hear and audibly pleasing.Overall, I'd give this game about an 8/10. The fan fix from github makes it a lot more bearable to play and a lot more fun.",Recommended,

I would even go as far as to suggest to skip playing the first game all together, as XIII-2 offers to catch you up, quite thoroughly, on past events.

Yoz,24.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yozshun/,"June 24, 2020",0,"This is a review that I want to separate between ""The Entire game"" and ""The last Episode"". It took me years to finally sit down and playing Final Fantasy 13-2, mainly due to the fact that the PC port is terrible. But with patches and mods the game is more than playable now and was a very pleasant experience. I had gotten this far into my life without ever knowing the ending or story to this game so I went in blind. All I knew was that Snow wasn't in it (I was wrong but its not like he plays a big role anyway) so that was already a mark against it.  The positives are the story is, at the least, engaging, and all the major set pieces do a good job at conveying the story and a message to the player. Unfortunately the story itself is pretty terrible, but time travel stories usually are. The combat is a slightly more polished FF13 with a pokemon monster battle system included. Honestly, the game is short, I beat it in about 20 hours. I don't have much to say about it. The ending was very good though, and that alone bumps it up for me a lot. I'll say this though, I'll probably never play this game again, but I feel like I got my money's worth.Onto my review of ""The Last Episode"" Up until the final two boss battles, this episode is, without question, the worst experience that I have had in a JRPG. The final dungeon is a waste of time, boring to look at, the music is also incredibly bland, the puzzle suck, and the dungeon mobs themselves are f'in annoying, to the point where a random mob is more powerful than any of the previous boss battles that I fought leading up to this point. I hated it. I hated the last two hours of this game so much that it was the final nail in the coffin as to whether or not I'd ever replay it. The game is saved by the last two bosses and the ending (I know there are multiple endings, but I'm  assuming the one I got was the real one) My overall rating is a 6.5/10. I'm, at the very least, happy to have played through the game, but honestly all the hate that FF13 gets is unjustified, but if it were directed at 13-2 specifically, I would probably jump on that hate bandwagon too.",Recommended,

High probability of crashing as purchased.The content and artistry of the game itself is a thumbs up.  Unfortunately, it's wrapped in a technical package that is prone to crashing without taking measures on your end to attempt to stabilize the game while it runs.  For my part, I'm using a so-called ""4GB patch""--for those who don't know, it's not that the patch is 4 Gigabytes in size, it's to allow the game to use more than the original 2GB memory limit imposed by hardware constraints when this game was originally developed... the patch itself is a few kilobytes.  I also had to disable cloud save due to crashing/hanging related to saving the game--in my case, the game would crash at points where it would normally save, and the save process completed because I could reload the game and it would resume right where it crashed, so I think it's some kind of interaction between the game and steam around save data that's causing the problem.I can't in good faith recommend this game, as it doesn't work as expected out-of-the-box so to speak.  I want to recommend this game, because I just replayed through FFXIII--on steam, no less, without having to do anything special--and just the opening sequence of this game reveals that the team who worked on the content side of FFXIII-2 took a lot of lessons from the first game and tried to evolve with this work.I DO recommend this game to those who are willing to do some troubleshooting to enjoy an otherwise worthwhile game.",Not Recommended,
Niles The Brave,51.6,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973966147/,"May 24, 2020",0,"This game is some sort of weird mixture of Pokemon, Final Fantasy, Doctor Who and an old school collectathon. Your third party members are three of a pretty large array of enemies you ""capture"" randomly throughout the game. The gameplay is a lot like FFXIII and the battle system will feel very familiar to you if you've played it. This time around instead of having a separate crystarium for each job class, there's just a single crystarium for all 6 roles which gives you a chance to (slightly) customize your characters if you're into max/min character development.The real depth comes from the monsters you collect. They each have their own crystariums, traits and skills they can learn. The monster crystarium is more similar to the sphere grid from FFX where you can use a part to level the monster up and choose which stat you want to raise.To make it more fun, you can also infuse your monster with other monsters that will allow it to gain spells and traits from the monster that's consumed. All in all, there's a lot of depth there if you want to dig deep, but it's not necessary if you just want to play through the game.The story is...there. It's time travel nonsense and it gets in it's own way more often than not. Noel is difficult to like and Serah is just missing something (these are your only two party members) to make the characters engaging. You get plenty of cameos if you're into that sort of thing, but overall I couldn't really tell you too much of what happened because time travel is annoying.Outside of your standard FF affair there's 160 fragments to collect throughout the game. This is Banjo-Kazooie style. Each area has X amount of fragments that you may or may not get a clue to find. It was a cool idea to see implemented in an RPG but it lacks the charm of what makes those old N64 collectathons fun to do and you'll be a little sick of it once you get in the 140s.There's also 9 ""paradox endings"" that you can unlock using some late game items that are somewhat interesting.This game is pretty easy to get 100% achievements on. I only had issue with slot machines and it took several hours of rubber banding my controller to unlock that one. There's also a super annoying quiz section that refuses to die in one area that you need to get through. Otherwise, it's not too hard to 100%Finally, this is a lazy port. You'll more than likely need to check the community guides to patch the game to make it work somewhat decent. Even then you get a lot of flickering and framerate issues but nothing game breaking and nothing that ruined my enjoyment of the game. The game crashed once, and in a very inopportune sport but that was the only real issue I had with this port.Also, there's an area where people just fall over for no reason, it was really captivating.",Recommended,

Lets get down to the issues, The most important issue I have found with this game is lack of stability. If you attempt to launch this game and do not have a controller plugged in or certain Human Interface Controllers disabled the game with freeze every 2-3 seconds. This sadly has only become the start of the problems with the game. Once a controller is used the game will have sequences that require keyboard buttons to be pressed however they don't work because the controller is the primary device. There are no options to set up a controller layout but it appears in the base coding of the game the features there.

I didn't mind this. The story is all over the place, literally. No longer the railroad cart of the first game, now you can choose where to go! It's sometimes a bit hard to follow, littered with various plot holes, but you get the main gist of it by the end. I sort of liked the first game more than this one, BUT the first one had cringy cutscenes. However, like the first game, the story isn't all that good. It's still a very basic game and doesn't take anywhere you haven't been.The game play is where it's at. Not only can you better customize your character progression but the third party member is a monster! You can go all Pokémon in this popsicle stand. You can capture, level up, and fight with basically any monster you encounter in the game. I feel the music is just as good as FFXIII. I can't see much of a change, but the first game did have a banger battle music. The art direction continues from the first one, awesome monsters and character designs.

This is one of the worst ports i have ever seen on a computer before. Ive owned this game for many years and still have put only 7 hours in. WHY DO YOU ASK? Because the performance sucks no matter what specs you have. i must have thrown more than 5 different types of PC rigs at this game and none of them ran at a stable framerate PLUS its capped at 30 fps POORLY it will jump to 45 to 30 to 35 in the span of a second. Im not even going to mention the amount of bugs this game has even if you can brute force your way through the framerate issues. This is the WORST way to Play FFXIII-2. if you want to play this go out and buy the ps3 version or xbox one backwards compatible title (you will thank me later) the only thing your missing are resolution and graphics options but the game runs 20 times more stable than any PC out there. I bought the ps3 version and despite being 720p its leagues better. IM SHOCKED WHY NO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS IN THEIR REVIEWS! WHAT ARE PEOPLE THINKING!

Oh, the game has crashed and locked Steam.  Disable cloud saves.  Restart the game, have to redo the intro since now have no save.  Control Serah.  Why do Serah and Noel start with the exact same known roles? Get to paradigm tutorial. Oh, the game has crashed and hard locked the PC. Download external fix.exe to get through tutorial.  Previously on Final Fantasy XIII-2 read to me by a Moogle.What a terrible introduction to a game, and indicative of Square-Enix's total lack of respect for PC consumers that this port was deemed acceptable to launch.Combat is essentially the same as FFXIII, except now your third party member is a monster. Monsters are captured in the form of crystals that drop (maybe) after you defeat that monster. Encounters are now random, as enemies will spawn out of the ether as you explore the world. You then have the time shown on your Moogle's 'mogclock' to attack the enemy and get a pre-emptive strike, run away from the encounter (unless the enemy is a meanie and chases you) or if the time runs out, get dragged into battle. You make your monsters stronger by feeding them materials of various tier levels (orbs, engines and other loots drops) to advance their 'crystarium', while you grow Serah and Noel via 'crystarium points' earned after battle.Filling the chain gauge and staggering enemies is perhaps less important in this game than its prequel. It's still the best way to deal big damage but I felt that Commandos could actually do a decent amount of damage outside of stagger, as opposed to just being there to keep the chain gauge from falling.The difficulty of bosses in this game comes from their endless, and I mean endless, use of de-buffs on your party and the absolutely awful wounding damage mechanic. Wound damage lowers max health, is completely worthless when used against enemies, and results in your companion monsters constantly dying and needing raised. You spend entire fights removing de-buffs so you can have 5 seconds of switching to an attacking paradigm. At this point the boss will probably use some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to remove all your buffs at once and hit you with 3-4 de-buffs again, and maybe spawn some extra mini-boss. Your own buffs last what seems like about 30 seconds, or as long as it takes to completely wear off before you get to make use of it, and the attack and magic boosting buffs (bravery and faith) can't be learned by Serah and Noel, necessitating bringing in a monster synergist.The music in this game is absolutely awful.  Normally you can rely on Final Fantasy games to have a decent OST.  XIII's wasn't stellar by any means but it wasn't completely offensive to the ears like this garbage.  Those responsible for the screamo-Chocobo song should be tried for crimes against humanity. What on Earth were they thinking, and who were the target audience for this tosh?What did they do to the rain? It looks atrocious. I needed to download a mod to make it look bearable - it hurts the eyes to look at.Why do the children fall over so often? They must all have inner ear infections.The clock-face anomaly puzzles - oh boy.  I can't think of a worse puzzle shoehorned into a game. I'm sorry Squenix, but I can't visualise a 12 step pattern in my head with a time limit and a random starting pattern. I doubt many people that aren't chess masters can.

The instant you start to think about how all of this works in more detail, you fall into chaos. I did not think it was bad, however. It's just time travel stories are always messy and this was no exception. I also didn't enjoy the battle system quite as much as last game. I liked being able to have 3 characters in my party. I didn't like that your 3rd party member was just a monster. I get it, but it still sucks. I do like Noel as a character though (more than Snow ngl). I loved seeing Hope's growth as a character. Coming from despising him for most of the first to respecting him greatly in 2 is a sight to see. Lighting remains a certifiable badass boss in every way.

It's less science fiction and more fantasy than FFXIII but this allows for the reintroduction of final fantasy favourites such as moggles without the the fantasy elements feeling out of place. I've seen a lot of people complain that FFXIII is too linear. FFXIII-2 allows the player to jump between locations at will. It also features a tonne of side quests  (some more engaging than others) and optional content. The PC version comes with the DLC from the Playstation version except for a few outfits which they couldn't port over for copyright versions.One main downside: this game was obviously designed to be lower budget. Maps are reused from FFXIII and even most of the new maps designed for FFXIII-2 are recycled at least once (you go to the same map in different time zones).

It improves all systems including combat and is very open, unlike the original. However, the port is AWFUL and fundamentally does not work unless you mod it and follow one of the performance/crash fix guides on the workshop. It still will not work too great after all that. There aren't really any current-gen alternatives except the xbox one/one x/series version, which have no problems and higher res cutscenes BUT they're locked at 30 fps regardless of if you're on one x/series x. PC is still a solid, playable alternative after the many fixes, with much better keyboard and mouse support. You may actually be able to go into this one after watching a summary video of the original, as it is rather disconnected anyway and fundamentally a lot more connected to lightning returns than FFXIII alone.TL;DR:- Better storytelling than FFXIII (you can actually get the full story without reading datalogs, a SHOCKING new innovation /s)- Some of the best, most refined yet innovative combat, systems, and progression in any jrpg- Open areas and systems with little handholding, which, while fundamentally better, can get a bit confusing- TERRIBLE PORT without mods",Recommended,

philosoraptorgames,73.0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198113261734/,"December 7, 2019",0,"EDITED TO ADD: I see that by far the most common complaint other reviewers have is instability or other issues with the port. All I can say is that I never experienced any of these problems. (And usually if there's technical issues that some people have and others don't, I get them really bad. I had an absolute nightmare with Divinity: Original Sin 2, for example.) The only technical issue I had with this game was occasional slowdowns that were fixed easily by turning off cloud saves. I can't promise you won't have those problems, but I can tell you they're not happening to everyone by any stretch of the imagination.ORIGINAL REVIEW: It's the same basic engine as FFXIII, but the gameplay experience is everything that game wasn't - exploration-oriented and radically non-linear, and fairly lighthearted despite the sometimes apocalyptic plot. This makes for a much more enjoyable gameplay experience than the dour, linear, and overly hand-holding FFXIII. I'd go so far as to call it the only direct sequel to a Final Fantasy game that is actually better than the game it's a sequel to. It's a bit simplified from its predecessor, though this is compensated somewhat by giving you access to almost all of the gameplay mechanics right from the beginning. The original Final Fantasy XIII eventually gave you a bit more to work with, but it took two thirds of the bloody game to get there, thus the common complaint that most of the game feels like a tutorial. The previous game's weapon upgrades are particularly missed, although working out which monsters to use in your third slot is at least as interesting.The characters are a bit flat, and while the plot sometimes uses its time-travel aspects in interesting ways, I suggest not trying too hard to work out how time-travel works here because ultimately it's pretty incoherent. My biggest complaint, though, is that the challenge level is very low even by Final Fantasy standards; slower advancement through the crystarium and giving out some abilities at much higher levels would have helped the pacing. Some may view this as a positive, as it does make the game very newcomer-friendly.Naturally it's gorgeous with a great soundtrack, it is a relatively modern Final Fantasy after all, and that alone would make it more enjoyable than not. If I can't give an unqualified recommendation, there's nevertheless a lot more to like here than not.",Recommended,

Red Magicite,61.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010139041/,"November 28, 2019",0,"This game is a massive improvement over FF 13. The battle system feels much tighter, you receive freedom of movement much sooner and the characters are far more likeable.  There are a fair amount of cameos from the old cast of 13, but it doesn't get too overbearing.As the game revolves around two core characters, in order to not break the battle system they introduced a monster system to replace a third tagalong character, where you need to feed upgrade items to improve them vs using the Crystarium system.  The monster system is interesting, but you won't have the money (or rather, gil) to really explore it until later on in the game unless you'd like to do a lot of farming.The story is a time travel romp, and the Non Canon Paradox Endings explore some of the more interesting aspects of what could be done with it.  Not everything is sunshine and daisies unfortunately:- The DLC (outside of outfits) is only accessible after beating the main story.- The Golden Saucer Equivalent, Serendipity, is not great.  Chocobo racing is ok, but Slots is painful, random, and you *need* to play and win a certain amount of money (which took my playthrough something like 6 hours) in order to unlock the True Ending. - There are some questionable design choices that just seem to be there to lengthen the game (some monsters, for example, only show up once a level - to get them to come back, you need to reset and play to where they spawn in the level again)While it isn't without flaws, if you're a fan of JRPGs, I imagine you'll enjoy it.",Recommended,

Do it before it destroys your experience on the game. I played it with minimal freezes and as long as 6-7hours. Learn to manually save although they do a good job sometimes. SOMETIMES.I bought this game for nostalgia purpose: it is a game you love to hate. For first timers playing it, you wont be lost in the sequel. Gameplay is relatively more easier than FFXIII, and more quests to take breaks from storyline. However, there is no replayability value, unless you love the game.I never grew to like the characters even till Lightning Returns. The world and lore is magnificiently developed, however with poor storytelling and even poorer character development. Everyone seems to be stagnant in a past (finding Serah, finding Lightning, getting over deaths and the vicious cycle repeats in the trilogy) when you thought FFXIII has helped pass that phase for the characters.

Otherwise if you're playing on a relatively new/powerful PC you will have a lot of issues with random crashing, various framerate fluctuations, audio cutting out, etc.As a rare sequel in the FF franchise (only 4 & 10/X had similar), it's much like FF13 with a few gameplay & character tweaks, including being able to change outfits as you please (hello, Serah fanservice right away!). As far as the story goes, you'll get much more out of it if you've finished 13 but it's not required.The big thing here is your PC really determines the game's quality-if your PC meets the minimum requirements but doesn't have a good processor and some VRAM the game is playable but the framerate will be poor and will stutter a lot. More powerful PCs make it look fantastic in HD but due to limitations of the port you may have a lot of issues although the aforementioned patch does help out.I would try and play all the way through 13 before checking this one out although it's not required. Good for the price (especially the awesome soundtrack) but I'd hold out for a sale. For now I only give it a slight thumbs-up due to the various technical issues.

I enjoyed the fact you can sort-of choose your own ""story timeline"" near the middle. I enjoyed the combat style - it feels fast action-y but also with strategic elements since different team formations lend to different add-on effects.My only grief with the game (and with most Final Fantasies tbh), is that you can be over-leveled for every stage... except the last! So you need to sit in the very last stage and grind monsters just so you can beat the last of the Final Bosses. I actually beat the 4 Final Bosses with relative ease and then the very last one is just so stupidly hard.

Ivan Osorio,92.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ivan_osorio/,"March 6, 2019",0,"Such mixed feelings with this game. In short: a sizable amount of people really hated XIII so they ran in the opposite direction in almost every regard. Personally, I thought XIII was kinda of OK, I really liked the battle system in that game for some reason, but it is undeniably an exercise in frustration in A LOT of ways. So they made XIII-2 and reused a lot of the assets to make something that could perhaps be a bit more compelling. A lot of open locations that you can walk around and interact with people, get quests, do some stuff and fight some monsters. And I like it. I like it a lot. I really enjoy the ""jumping around from time to time while trying to make a better future"" structure of the game. It makes locations worth revisiting and it's interesting to see the changes. I even enjoy the crystal fragment collecathon thing they have going on. I like the extra bosses and the completely optional locales that do nothing but flesh out the world and the characters. There is a lot of interesting things that are actively hidden in this game. Having said all that, it's bizarre to think about how 20 years ago Chrono Trigger did this way better, but XIII-2 is still really enjoyable in its own right.My main problem with XIII-2 is pretty much the same as it was with XIII: The story is complete garbage. It's just complete garbage in a different way. XIII suffered from an incomprehensible plot obscured by terms that weren't explained until 3/4 of the game, and a party that had no idea what it actually wanted to do until the last hour of gameplay. Meanwhile, XIII-2 suffers from having an atrocious plot that is explained excessively at every corner, no one misses a chance to spout exposition, but they mostly just say words that make no sense in context or otherwise. The game is loaded with some of the biggest plot holes this side David Cage. People just say stuff and it's true but there is no context for more than half of it. Noel is a potentially interesting character but he is very badly realized in the context of the game. Everyone else ranges from mediocre to terrible. Playing it on the PC, after having already done so in the PS3, I am sure I made the correct decision: Skipping every single main story cutscene made this immensely more enjoyable. The only redeemable feature of this game's story is, ironic as that may be, its ending. Because even though it is nothing but a hook for Lightning Returns in the most blatant ""to be continued"" way possible (and I mean it literally says ""to be continued"" in the ending), it is still the one and only time in the entire game where the writers set up a major plot point and followed through with it, and it works really well.XIII-2 is very similar to X-2 in a lot of ways, now that I think about it, and I enjoy it for largely the same reasons: an interesting world and game mechanics, varied quests, nice battle system that scales nicely and presents good challenge. But it's hampered by exactly the same factor as well, something that has plagued every single Square-Enix game since the merger: No one in that company actually knows how to write a compelling story anymore.Atrocious port. I can run Monster Hunter World with stable frame rates and this damn game stutters frequently, frame rates drop to what looks like single digits in some camera turns. It's bizarre. Also this is the only game I've played in this computer (out of 60+) where sometimes my graphics card just shuts down for 3 seconds and has to turn on again. Really bizarre stuff.",Recommended,

As such, I've had some standards that I look for in all Final Fantasy games. FFX was my favorite, with a great storyline that didn't make me feel trapped in a linear path. FFXII was great for giving us open battle and a great story as well. FFXIII for having a fantastic story line. FFXV for having a great story with all around brand new mechanics to breath life into the series. I enjoyed FFXIII for the story as well and the less complecated level system compared to FFX. This game, however, has taken found some way to not incorporate any of the above things, which is amazing. Combat is...again...random with load screens for each battle. Escaping is difficult and getting premeptive strikes impossible on a decent number of enemies. Like FFXIII, it's auto-battle until they die unless you need healing. The story line seems like it was built to give clarity as you go on, but it just seems like one big convulted mess.One thing I always loved was mini-games, as they provided a quick distraction. Now, those mini-games are mandatory and timed, so the fun is replaced by forced challenge. At least in previous games you had they opprotunity to study as you went, letting everyone enjoy at their own pace. Not to mention sidequests, which only indicate the original quest giver on the map, not the target. This would be fine in a game that offered decent options to reduce or remove random encounters, or had encounters you could see coming, like it's predecessor. Instead, in most cases, you're wandering around blindly, coming across fight after fight that you're over-levelled enough for the load time to not even be worth it.If you're like me and NEED the story to be completed across all games, wait for a sale, but dont anticipate enjoying this game. I've put it down many times over the last few weeks just to play ANYTHING else. It feels like a chore to play sometimes, which is a shame for a series I love so much. If you don't need to play more of the story, do a solid pass and move on to another game. Not worth it for those who dont feel a compulsion to play.

The things that I like most about it are the battle system that was carried over from FF XIII and the monster catching idea. I really enjoy monster catching games and I feel like it's done rather well in this game. There are so many differnt monsters to choose from and you're able to level them and infuse them to customize them however you want. If you do a quick google search you'll be able to make some pretty broken monsters so it's probably best if you sit back and enjoy the process first before you look anything up.Another thing that I like is the idea of time traveling, being able to revisit the same places, and being able to actually replay each part of the game as much as you want. When it comes to the plot there isn't much that makes sense but if you don't take it too seriously then you'll be able to enjoy the game.

I don't hate the game, but in terms of story, it kinda feels un-needed, XIII had a happy ending, but then this came along like ""You know that happy ending? F**k that happy ending"" the game is enjoyable, with over double the amount of Side quests XIII had, and a MUCH less expensive Crystarium. Another problem I had was with the monsters because it felt like it hindered your Paradigms, but That's a minor thing which doesn't affecr the game too much. Also this comes with all the DLC which means you won't need to pay out anymore than you already have for extra content :'D",Recommended,

jwang,37.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jwang19/,"September 2, 2018",0,"Final Fantasy XIII-2 is the direct sequel to the hot garbage known as Final Fantasy XIII. I would have never guessed that I would have had so much fun with FFXIII-2 after my soul-draining experience with FFXIII. It is no exaggeration that Square Enix took fan feedback from the first game close to their hearts and did a thorough a 180° with this game. In fact, Square Enix made such drastic measures that they retconned the ending of FFXIII and pretty much wrote away most of the L’Cie, Fal’Cie and focus jargon. This is one of the few games I’ve played where the sequel is so much better than its’ predecessor that you could just pretend that the first game never existed (another game series that comes to mind is Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2).The story takes place directly after FFXIII and changes the ending. Instead of Lightning reuniting with her sister Serah, Lightning is literally erased from history and everyone believes that she sacrificed herself along with Vanille and Fang to save the inhabitants of Cocoon. The only person that seems to remember what truly happened is Serah. The cause of all this is Caius, a man in a purple jumpsuit and wields a cool looking sword eye weapon who has manipulated time itself for some nefarious purpose. It is up to Serah and Noel, a mysterious time traveler from the future to fix the time paradoxes and confront Caius. As a time travel story, the game completely misses the mark and tries to explain mysterious things because of “time magic”. Fortunately at least what FFXIII-2’s story has going for it is that it is at least mildly comprehensible with no need to consult the Datalog. There are also nice episodic recaps everytime you load your save. In the first hour of gameplay you can tell Square Enix immediately did right with this game. Characters no longer spout non sequiturs at each other. There are multiple branching paths to explore. You can actually talk and have conversations with NPCs! And finally you can access most of the gameplay immediately with the rest unlocking within the first three hours. The Paradigm system from FFXIII also got a revamp. Serah and Noel will always be in your party, with a rotating slot used for monsters. That’s right, FFXIII-2 is also a Pokėmon-esk monster collecting game! Each monster represents a specific Crystarium role and it becomes a quest in itself to find and raise the best Commandos, Ravagers, Medics, etc. That said if you didn’t enjoy the Paradigm system in the first game, this game will not be changing your mind.I was not a fan of some of the other changes that Square Enix has made. For some reason they learned that that QTEs are pretty popular with the kids these days and included them throughout the game. The QTEs show up in cutscenes and during battle. Hitting every QTE will deal bonus damage or reward you with a special prize. Fortunately failing the QTEs isn’t an automatic fail.Another feature included is branching dialog sequences. While branching dialog is much appreciated as it helps flesh out Serah and Noel, it usually only rewards an item if you pick the one correct/serious choice..There are also severe pacing issues with FFXIII-2.The first 4 episodes are fairly easy and straightforward to follow. The 5th episode is gated off until Serah and Noel collect 5 specific fragments located in various timelines.The game give you hints in which timelines and areas to find these fragments, but the problem is, the game does not tell you how. In order to reach these specific timelines, you need to have enough Wild Artefacts, the keys to opening these timelines. The game never keeps track of which locations have Wild Artefacts are in them and it becomes painfully annoying to scour through each and every timeline for them. The problem is also exacerbated when these Wild Artefacts are impossible to access without pursuing some relatively long quest lines. Unless if by dumb luck you opened the right timelines and did the right quests, I strongly recommend resorting to a guide if you get stuck at this point.FFXIII-2 suffers from a low production value and most of the content is recycled from the original game. The new music is eclectic and random and doesn’t quite feel like a Final Fantasy soundtrack.There are some catchy tracks like the Red Chocobo song, but also random ones like this heavy metal song they put in some boss fights. Most of the character models and monsters are recycled from the original. Voice acting with the exception of the main cast is shotty with Mog being the most annoying to listen to. Lip syncing is poorly done and you can notice characters moving their lips but not matching what they’re saying.The poor production values also creep their way onto the PC port of the game. On Windows 10, the game will crash within the first few minutes of gameplay due to a memory issue. The framerate advertised to run up to 60 FPS, regularly dips down to 30 FPS even on powerful rigs. I experienced no issues playing FFXIII on PC so it’s strange how all of these bugs happen with the sequel. Luckily there is a great FF fan community that has provided most of the fixes to these issues (see: . It is a shame that Square Enix did not patch their game even though it has been released almost 4 years ago and counting.Final Fantasy XIII-2 feels like a game that took major risks and paid off. Rather than living in the shadow of the first game and playing it safe, Square Enix decided to take the series into a whole new direction with this sequel. The game oozes with new ideas, some brilliant and some awful. This is a game that is so different from its’ predecessor that saying it is the sequel to Final Fantasy XIII is an insult. Yes, it is using the same main characters and battle system, but it does so much more than the original. Despite my complaints, I enjoyed my time playing Final Fantasy XIII-2 look forward to playing the end of the trilogy: Lightning Returns.",Recommended,
animeshifter16,103.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198261673249/,"September 2, 2018",0,"Probably my favorite FF game to date.So being an a continuation of FF13 you need to have played that game or know the events that happened in it to even grasp what is even happening in this game.  But I'm got to say that this game did MANY more things right than wrong, and truly showed that critique was heard loud and clear from the previous game.  Before reading the nitpicks, I HIGHLY recommend giving this game a go.The Good:-Unique Battle System that incorporates monsters that you can capture.  Like FFX-2 but way better and you learn as you go and it encourages experimentation.-An amazing and diverse soundtrack. *Honestly a big reason why I keep coming back to the FF13 series*.-You can revisit areas you've seen before unlike FF13.-DLC is quite good and highly recommend getting for the hardcore endgame fights and Sazh.-The game feels big and there can be a lot to explore and nice rewards for doing so.-It is no longer game over if your party leader dies!!!!The Meh:-FF is know to have some complicated puzzles and this edition is no exception as you will be running into them a lot, and some can be quite rewarding to figure out, but if you can't there are puzzle solvers online to help.- While I absolutely love the monster system, one aspect that FFX-2 beats it in is customizing their abilities outside their skilltree can be a pain.-Serah is not the most....endearing character, but she has her moments.The Yikes:-While not necessary to beat the game in anyway, there is a ""collectible"" for completing all the maps which is REALLY tough in some places so good luck.",Recommended,
[YJL] ZondaFreak,179.8,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993763693/,"August 27, 2018",0,"Final Fantasy XIII-2 carries on where the previous title left off, with Serah searching for her sister. This title overall is far less difficult than its predecessor, less linear and also a little more open-ended.If you played FFXIII, you'll be familiar with the paradigm combat system. In this title you create up to three sets, or packs, of paradigms for use in different situations. However, instead of 3 humans, your party will consist of Serah, Noel and a tamed beast which fulfills a fixed role. You capture these beasts by defeating them in battle; each has a set capture chance. Sound vaguely familiar? Yes, this is somewhat like Pokemon.Once captured, each of your monsters will have a crystarium of their own. Instead of using traditional CP as you're used to and will do for Serah and Noel, for the monsters, you'll spend resources you acquire as drops through battles to level them up. You can also infuse them with skills and passive attributes from other monsters you've captured to make them even stronger. Your creativity is the limit in what types of paradigm packs you create.The way in which the story is managed, through the Historia Crux, is unique. This central hub allows you to traverse time as you so chose, providing quick access to all the gates you have opened to specific locations. From here you can also close a gate and roll back the story to where you were before you arrived at the gate you just closed. You can then replay everything up to this point all over again, while still maintaining your stats and cast of monsters. If at any point you want to revert to your original forward progress, return to the Historia Crux and just open the closed gate. All will be restored, again with no impact on your team. It's a really cool system in my opinion.There are still various weapons and accessories for your characters to employ, but the demands on grinding out gil or special resources (read: trapezohedrons) to get the best gear are gone. The best weapons are acquired through more reasonable methods. Also, it's worth reiterating this game is much more forgiving in combat than FFXIII as there are no hard caps on stats based on your degree of progress in the story.If there is a minor drawback, it's the graphics. The pre-recorded cinematics are not at all up to the level of FFXIII, which was like watching a film at times, but for the era this game was released in, the visuals are still good. Framerates can be a little shaky, especially while moving around towns or other areas, but combat is pretty fluid. Overall, considering the rest of the package, this issue is not too difficult to overlook.I've played this title off and on since 2011 and still find it enjoyable.

Baltasar,98.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/r2p/,"April 17, 2018",0,"FFXIII-2 continues the story of FFXIII seconds after it ended. The timeline is changed by some tiny details, but the consequences are huge. This time around, you don't run from scene to scene in one long story hose, but you can travel through time and space from some sort of hub world. Every place in this game has at least one extra time you can travel to. Say, you're in year 10 of some place, but a rock blocks your path, so you travel to year 2 and prevent the rock from being there in the first place. You also don't have to do everything in a specific order and you can progress several threads of the story at the same time.The combat system is quite unusual, although upon further inspection, it really is an amalgam of the usual FF ""ATB"" (Active Time Battle, a half real time, half turn based system) and FFX-2's role system, mixed with some FFXII style AI ""what to do when"". The system expanded a bit since FF13, you can now pick your team leader. Since there are only two playable characters, you'll have to catch, level and breed monsters as a third player. Monsters can have only one role, but you can have three monsters in the third slot to toggle through at the same time. If your main is killed, the game switches to the other character automatically, so this time around, a healing role as non-main actually makes sense. The roles can be fine tuned this time. The level system has also been changed, it looks simpler, but you actually got more choice than in FFXIII.They also added some sort of QTE system in film sequences. You're presented with a choice of buttons and different effects (use magic or use melee). You can then decide what to do or do nothing. Those choices usually have minor consequences, but they always change something.As usual for an FF game, the game itself isn't very hard, but there is a grind-intensive endgame, if you really want to do everything.The PC port of this not without problems, most of them are the same as in FFXIII:- Aggressive VSync goes down to 30, if 60 cannot be held for a very short time. This produced an annoying fps lag on my machine, I had to limit the FPS to 30 with an external tool.- Framerates other than 30-60 will do weird things to the engine.- The general performance is wonky at best. I think it's still better than the PS3 version, because here you have a chance at playing the game in a high resolution with some AA at 30+ FPS, while the PS3 version struggled to maintain its 30 FPS at the 720p internal resolution.- The game constantly polls USB HID devices for controllers. If you have no controller connected, you'll probably get a nasty stuttering effect. There are workarounds, but a controller is suggested.- The game plays well with two or six sound channels. Anything but 2.0 or 5.1 is likely to warp your audio channels around.- Cloud saving crashes the game for some people. I recommend turning it off, because there is no actual map of which points break the game.- There is a slim chance of a game breaking bug in the first five minutes of the game. Without spoiling too much, you'll see your character leave the battle screen, but the game won't end the battle. In this case, restart the game and skip the scenes. Once you've seen the first ""score card"", you'll know you're fine.",Recommended,

Two songs stand out the most (listing their names not their appearances due to spoilers): Invisible Depths and Limit Break.The plot is... urgh. FF13-1's was waaaay overcomplicated, with many of the finer plot details left to datalog entries and so many unexplained crazy naming conventions. Add time travel on top of that and you have, well, pretty much a clusterf***. However, all is not lost here, for the main cast is easily the driving force of this game. Serah and Noel are decent characters, but the main antagonist, Caius Ballad, easily takes the cake. I mean, I totally empathized with the guy, to the point where though I understood where Serah and Noel were coming from, I really wished Caius would have won, because his feelings and motivations were so genuine. And if I had the powers he had and the same backstory, I would have done the same. Because, really, the world matters little if you are fated to see the one you love die over, over, over and over again until the end of time.I would call FF13-2 a rough diamond. Definitely better in terms of gameplay than either 13 or Lightning Returns, but it suffers from some plot-related issues, some stemming from the convoluted 13 and some stemming from the time-travel motif. Still, by far and large the best game of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy,",Recommended,

Since then, all of the issues have been fixed thanks to fan-made patch that can be found on PC Gaming Wiki. I would recommend this game now because of its good performance and it being a high quality game.So Final Fantasy XIII-2 is actually a pretty good game, but this port is garbage and I do not recommend getting it. You may see that I have less than an hour of gametime myself because, despite reading all the warnings here, I thought my system would be different and I could enjoy the game. However, despite having a GTX1060 an i5 7500, more than enough to play Final Fantasy XIII and Lightning Returns with no issue, this game barely plays at a consistent 30fps. From the limited research I did, it is possible to increse your FPS by doing various steps that shoudl not be required to play this game at an acceptable frame rate, but even still most people never achieve a solid 60fps. This port is terribly optimized, and I advise strongly agaisnt anyone purchasing this game--even on sale. That was just the issue I experienced. Others have reported CTDs that I did not experience, but this issue alone is unacceptable.If you want to play this game, I recommend picking up a copy on Xbox 360 or PS3.

Less linear than the last one, more freedom to explore areas and to play a character thats not a complete douche for eighty-five percent of the game. Right off the bat I like Serah and Noel.

This may be a pc thing but this game runs much better on my pc and it looks better too.I may be a bad person to review this because Final Fantasy is my favorite game series ever. There is only one I didn't like and that was Final Fantasy 12 because it had problems that are fixe in The Zodiac Age. Let me start by saying No I have not had any issue with frame drops or any other issues except for the buzzing audio which was fixed by running compatibility moe for windows vista. That aside it was not the best story ever but it is a great go between for FFXIII and Lightning Returns. It gives you all you need to know about FFXII and enough to get you interested in Lightning Returns. My only real gripe with the game is the metal music during bosses fights. Now I love metal of all kinds but it is too fast for how thoughtful some of the fights need to be. I can recommend this game for the above reasons. I had alot of fun completing this game I will continue to play it too 100% completion. As of right now I love wandering around looking at scenary and fighting endless droves of monsters trust me if you are a fan of Final Fantasy its worth a play.

But with all the negative reviews, especially of crashes and lags I was hesitant for a long time. I finally decided even if it is lag crazy I really really wanted to know the plot and how this story/trilogy was going to be played out so I bought it and played it.It lagged and crashed horribly. The first couple of episodes it felt like I was swimming through thick goo. But whatever. I was ready for that and kept on playing. Then my ancient graphics card overheated and died. (Not due to playing this game, although it happened while I was playing it. A poorly placed cord near the graphics card moved at some point and blocked the graphics card fan from spinning.) Somehow though I acquired a fairly new 2016 graphics card for free through a co-worker and installed it onto my, I have no clue how long I've had this thing, computer and it worked great. No more lags, no more crashes. So as long as you're not playing on a laptop or trying to record yourself for YouTube, and have a fairly new, decent graphics card, playing this game should be no big deal. (Just for reference, I have Windows 10, and my processor is a duo-core or something like that, not even a quad, and at least 8 years old or more.)As for the game itself, I enjoyed the game better than the original. I don't have to grind to get through it and I can just enjoy playing it. I don't care about getting the rare whatever or the best thingamajig. I like that you play the same characters from beginning to end unlike the original where you keep jumping around (that made it hard for me to get into the game since I didn't feel attached to anyone.)Not really sure what people mean by bad port. The game seems perfectly fine to me (but it's been awhile since I've owned a console of any sort). But I'm one of those people that can't tell the audio difference between a MP3 and a WAV format so if you're into PS4 like graphics then maybe this game will be disappointing?

Its actually more of a gamble then anything. Saving is a double edge sword on here. If it works, great no worry. If it doesnt, well it crashes and you lose everything up to that save point. Solution? Play a bit, save. Play a bit, Save. It will crash, reopen. I spend just as much time reopening the darn thing as I get before I save in the first place. Its actually a REALLY glaring issue. I see for a lot of people, this happens on start up, for me, I at least get to taste a bit of the Final Fantasy Pie, but not enough to get full. Its as if everytime i put a fork into the piece, someone takes it from me and puts it back in a plate. As far as I have seen, there is no solution (other then being on like a Nasa level computer... even then I doubt that will fix this.)I mean, the rest of the port is pretty good. There does appear to be some missing DLC stuff, but that is something I understand happens when you have a game come over to PS3, and the promotion or something ends. However, Everything is forgiveable except for that crashing. Buy at your own choice. Personally, out of all versions I have played of this game shell out for the PS3 copy.

Out of all the XIII games in the trilogy, this one has received by far the worst optimisation. Without community patches, you will not have a good time with this. Constant crashing, the occasional horrible buzzing sound noise and frame stutters galore, rain that looks like milk and it constantly wants to use Keyboard prompts instead of controller, and even though there is a way to set it to controller, you have to make sure you set it to that each time you launch the game. It took me two hours of patch-work before I could finally get it in a playable state I was happy with but even then still, it's not perfect.

Generally, any sequel is a bit of a slaughtering of the original. Not just because it is essentially ""milking it"" but also because we have lived in an original world and now we are distorting that original.2. I did not like the cliffhanger at the end. Particularly that it leads to the disaster that the Lightning Returns was.3. The markers of map are confusing. Sometimes a lot.OK, what do I like about it:1. I like the transitioning of characters. They are quite real. You can accept that character turning to this. They match their world and they feel, even more than the first episode, like the older games of the series.2. It is a bit of a difficult game but not too much. They have successfully managed to create a world in which you would be rewarded by doing more side quests.3. Without going into spoiling stuff, the physics of the game and everything about it which has changed has not really broken your link to the original. It is well enough that after a year of playing them you may not exactly remember what fight was in which game unless you try to remember the story sequence leading to it.And to address an old argument: The original is often called a tunnel simulator. It is often criticized for being linear. Well I don't care personally, but yes, this one is less linear. But not even close to an open world.Overall? If you liked the first one, give it a try.

KOEK.jpg,58.5,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978205391/,"November 26, 2016",0,"To me, it's unfortunate that the string of Final Fantasy games that were released with the main number of XIII are written off as lousy games. Yes, they all have flaws, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy playing them. FF XIII-2 is a prime example of such a game.When you release a sequel, the game will inevitably be compared to the source material and I'll do such a thing here as well. While I personally enjoyed XIII, it has received its fair share of critizism. The complaints were mainly aimed at the long tutorial sequence, the linear gameplay and the convoluted story. It also had some other issues, such as a long transition time between the first paradigm shift (the battle system in these games) and the sometimes uninteresting or downright annoying characters.Square seemed to have done something about most complaints with the sequel. For starters, the opening level (playing as Lightning, the protagonist of the first game) is pretty interesting and while the tutorial sequence with Serah (Lightning's little sister) is a bit tedious again, it doesn't drag on for hours to come. Besides that, there are many ways to explore and revisit different regions and they give the player more options to choose from and more routes to follow. This is probably the biggest change compared to its predecessor and it really helps the game.I myself embrace most of the changes they made compared to the first game. Like I said, I enjoyed XIII, but most annoyances I had with the first game are removed. For instance, it took me about 60 hours to finish XIII and a few sidequests but it took me ANOTHER 65 hours to wrap up every achievement in the game, including having to grind the toughest enemy of the game in the hope of getting an item I needed for every weapon available. It's way less tedious to complete everything in XIII-2, with the chocobo rider and slot machine achievements being the exceptions. Most battles are now avoidable, which is also a step up from XIII. They also improved and simplified the leveling system, sped up the first paradigm shift and gave us the opportunity to use monsters as part of the team.Another feature they added in this game is the possibility of alternate endings. While some can be found and viewed during your regular playthrough, most can only be seen after beating the final boss. That also brings us to the post-game content. There are many fragments in each world that serve as a sorts of collectibles. Some serve a purpose, for instance opening a portal to a new and unexplored world or timezone. Some are easier to find than others. The alternative endings you view also net you a fragment for that region. With the time map you use to explore the worlds, it's easy to see if you have found every fragment in that world and time zone. What's even more interesting is that you have the power to ""rewind"" a certain section of the game, meaning you can go back and play that part of the story as if you had never set foot on the world before. This serves as a fun way to kill time and make sure you have explored every nook and cranny of the game.The biggest drawback of XIII is the story. While XIII's story was convoluted and complicated if you didn't take the time to read TONS of story-related content in your menu, XIII-2's story is just too simple. Every problem in the world has to do with time paradoxes and time-travel (which is a key part of the gameplay as well) and they can all be resolved by fixing said paradoxes. That's as straightforward as it can get. The game has a really interesting enemy in the form of Caius Ballad, though he's mainly made interesting by some stellar voice acting by Liam O'Brien. The fights with him are especially very epic and the first battle with Caius proves a hefty challenge if you don't level up some more. It's too bad he didn't get as much screen time he deserved.That being said, the game is still very much enjoyable.

I feel it falls a little short of the 'wow' factor that FFXIII had, but it also has its own moments. Characters are ok, with all of the originals (main cast) returning in some way or another. Noel is not a bad addition to the cast and his overall arc is decent. Sarah (who I never really liked anyways) is still the same innocent/clueless girl she seemed like in the first game and was maybe the worst part about the game to me personally. I felt like her arc was almost non-existant.Overall story was good, not great. I liked to whole timeline element they had going, but I feel like they could have done a little bit more with it to really feel like what you were doing in the past made a difference.The soundtracks were probably the best part of the game for me.

Story plot feels unconnected from the previous game. It feels like a spin-off more than a sequel. Basically you play as a pinkhead girl with her new mate, do time traveling, monster catching, and some other stuffs. Check out some gameplay videos and see if you like that or not. Personally, I found it sort of medicore. It'd be okay to play only if it ran well on your pc which is likely not. It runs Horrible and unreasonable at all, even worse than the XIII. I rarely judged games based on performance nor optimization but this one deserves it. I just reinstalled the game to checked it, and after 2 years sinced released, the result is the same. It doesn't seem to maximize using the resource at all (My pc usage is mostly at ~30% when running it, AMD processor). Gotta say this is the worst pc port game I've ever experienced.

The story itself is not as gripping as I found the first game (albiet still not entirely gripping), and thus I found myself not playing the game for long periods, which cut immersion and furthered my lack of interest. After finally completing the first game, I thought of completing this one just so I can say I've done it and having gotten past Bresha Ruins 005 and starting the next parts I found the game crashing and freezing multiple times. Next to this, the poor graphics for the rain let the game down as well as it's really not pleasing to have white lines falling down the screen pretending to be rain. Overall, the game is probably alright for those who can deal with a lacking story line and a main character whose intelligence fluctuates frequently in trying to be somewhat flirty and then knowledgable.

Katt,50.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kattuska/,"May 31, 2016",0,"FF XIII-2 is surprisingly good and enjoyable game. I didn’t expect much after XIII which was mediocore after all and maybe I am too kind. I liked XIII-2 from the beginning on the contrary of its predecessor.Characters and story are not the strongest ones in franchise but it worked just fine. Time travelling to various locations and even to parallel times is fresh idea (Chrono Trigger was first and better,yea I know.) and really fun to explore all the areas. Also several endings which were unxepectedly brutal and sad reminded me Chrono Trigger again. Story and time paradoxes are sometimes a bit confusing but nothing too awkward.Battles are pretty much the same as in XIII. Team includes 2 main chars and one tamed monster (I sticked with healing Cait Sith nearly whole game and then I got healing slime…epic team). Taming monsters in new feature, along with live triggers (wannabe dialogue options), quick-time events (lovely on the keyboard), time rifts with logical puzzles and moogle skills such as throwing him to find treasures and revealing invisible things.PC port is ok – game looks great. FPS rarely drops but nothing serious. Controls are worse case, I recommend controller because of quick-time events and for scoring pre-empive strikes. Music is questionable – I like Nobuo-san music in older games so much more and I really don’t remember more than 3 tracks from this game. Main theme is fine, Ending Japanese romantic pop song is also good, weird rap song from Bresha ruins and awful nu-metal remake of chocobo theme are not my favorites. Dual subs works here, so I played with Japanese audio/English subtitles and had nothing to complain.Long story short – you have to be brave and complete FF XIII to enjoy this much better game. I think it is the biggest minus.*I wish they made remake of Chrono Trigger in bad-ass graphic…",Recommended,

It does it very well (in my opinion) and is the strongest game, story-wise, in the Lightning Saga.Gameplay;It has a streamlined, simplified version of FF13's ATB battle system.  Serah and Noel are your two static characters, with your third character being a tamed monster of a fixed role.  You can have up to 3 differnet monsters in your ""Party Pack"" that you can use to make paradigms.  Still a good system, but I prefer FF13's.Difficulty;This is a pretty big one for me.  There's almost no difficulty at all here. The superbosses, as you might expect them to be, aren't a challenge at all.  I came across both of them while doing sidequests with no preperation at all and was able to defeat them with ease.  I didn't even know they were supposed to be ""superbosses.""

Warmo,8.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrwarmo/,"April 10, 2016",0,"After completing the game on PS3, I decided to give the PC port a go, I read up that the FF 13 ports were bad, but as I played, they were terrible! (And FFXIII is worse!) I am playing on a top gaming PC (6700k processor and NVIDIA 980ti) and I get stuttering and framerate drops (Apart from when in combat which is wierd) Anyway, ignoring the issues with the bad port, this game is amazing, I have never had the patience to play a FF game before and this is the first FF game I have actually completed. The game sadly follows on from FF XIII which is essentially a corridor simulator with a boss at the end of each one. Luckily this has been thrown out of the window and replaced with free-roaming, exploring, time travel and paradoxes, plus the okay combat system from its predecessor makes this a interesting game to play. Sadly, because of the exploring, the story can be mixed up and forgotten. On PS3, I came back to the game after around a year of not playing, I had to re-trace my steps using walkthroughs to figure out what I had to do and if I had missed anything. The biggest problem for me is the part of the game where you have to collect 'gravitron cores' as they are in different times. To get into the times is the hardest part because they are unlocked in steps, it may take a while to get to the place you need to go. Lastly, the menu system and item recording is a bit wierd. There is no way to figure out where you collected previous (and used) wild artifacts which is just confusing for the 'cores' questTLDR: If you have a lot of patience (And its a steam sale) Buy this game.

jpsf91,135.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/,"April 7, 2016",0,"Final Fantasy XIII wasn't a bad game, just a disappointing one. However, it had a good conclusion, and a sequel wasn't needed or wanted. But Final Fantasy XIII-2 truly feels like a Final Fantasy game, and in almost every way is how XIII should have been in the first place. If you enjoyed XIII, you'll love XIII-2. If you didn't, you'll probably enjoy XIII-2. Knowing the story of XIII helps, but isn't very important. So, what's improved? The combat is mostly the same when it finally got good in XIII. But here, you have it in full force in around 2 hours. The paradigm shift animations were removed, making the combat more fluid. There's only 2 permanent party members, so the third needed to be filled. And that's where the monster capture mechanic comes in, using defeated monsters in battle with you, where you can level them up and combine them. And it's actually fun, but the infusion mechanics are a bit complicated. You can change you party members in battle and are forced to in you're leader is KO'ed, but unfortunately you cannot control the monsters. That would be cool. Now the maps are more open, and you can revisit almost all areas at almost any time. There's more side quests, but most of them are just collecting stuff. It definitely isn't linear as XIII. As a bonus, you can also play in slot machines or participate in chocobo races. Random encounters are back, and for the most part you can avoid them if you want. Leveling weapons and accessories is more traditional, using some monster drops to upgrade them one time at best. The graphics are a bit improved, but i prefered the original animations and locations. The music is a bit worse, but still pretty good. They even added some great songs from XIII, and it doesn't feel like cheap, but as an addition. The story is shorter and weaker, but the characters are more interesting, some of them. My favourite was definitely the new main villain, Caius Ballad. What i didn't like was the sequel baiting ending. The PC version also includes most of the consoles DLC, including another Lightning vs. Caius battle, poker and an original card game, and my favourite: additional boss battles, including two very hard superbosses (one of them is Gilgamesh). In the end, XIII-2 has a XIII feel, but returns with many of the things that make the Final Fantasy series great, at least in the gameplay.BUT...The PC port is horrible. XIII wasn't good either, but XIII-2 is really bad on PC, mainly because it has worst performance, lots of low FPS and FPS drops, and crashes randomly including when you save with the Steam Cloud active. You can use the cloud to backup your save, but i don't recommend you to use it as a regular save feature. And sadly the game most likely won't be fixed. And it's a shame. A much better sequel with a much worst port. If your PC can handle it and if you're ready to play a bad PC port, i can recommend it.",Recommended,
Chummy 8,38.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001980312/,"April 3, 2016",0,"As the middle chapter of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, I considered this game a must play after finishing FF 13. Final Fantasy 13-2 is the story of Serah, Noel, and the Time Rangers. Time is broken and it's up to them to solve history. As Time Travel stories go, I've seen worse and more confusing ones. 13-2 gets going right out of the gate in stark contrast of FF 13 which took about 10 hours before it opened up.  In this game, you can explore right from the the start. The combat system is the same paradigm system from the first game with the added touch of monster taming. Tamed monsters fight with you in battle as part of your paradigms and, most monsters in the game can be tamed;each coming with their own active and passive benefits. Taming  monsters became my thing as I sought out and farmed specific monsters to add to my party.The combat system never got boring, the story kept me interested until the end, and the monster farming added a fun side thing to do. Sure this is a Jrpg ass jrpg and got anime AF at times. But that's pretty much what I was expecting from a Final Fantasy game.  Some people on here were griping about the frame rate, but, I never experienced any FPS issues.  Worth the purchase. This game also has a primer that tells the story of Final Fantasy 13 very well so you can skip the first game and not feel that you missed out on anything.

The ensemble, characters, story, graphics, music & (re)playability are awesome and beautiful (kawaiii !!).The game is just beautiful (aka Kawaii), the illumination blends very well acrosss every environment from cities to the  wildlands. It's not a flat grey land, or a scenery full of glow, The FF XIII-2 design is just great from the start to the end.Well, the soundtrack mixes good tracks of  modern guitar rock, instrumental (classical/baroque) and piano... along the game you'll hear some tracks full of voice and lyrics. The blend between the play and music is as you can expect.. awesome.Personally, I like The Last Hunter, Knight of The Goddess, Eclipse, New Bodum, Plains of Eternity, Run ...Enjoyable, It can be played using the keyboard. The turn-based strategy was crafted to enjoy the combat... the paradigm switch is faster (than in XIII) and you can wander around every map looking for combats or just going to the mission objectives. Some interactions are needed in cinematic time, great!. You can tame almost every monster to fight in your team, i like this idea. A really big dog fights in my team ...lol.The story is not dependant on FF XIII, the game can be enjoyed as a standalone game. The story involves time travel, fighting for what is worth, frienship and trust, all in all the storyline is clear (not crystal clear but clear) and the characters are well defined...You can choose to play the role of the boy or the girl... in any case you can use magic, and close combat but you must choose carefully what abiities you develops first.The replayability is guaranteed, to get extra items, to explore the maps, to accomplish secondary missions, and so on. The bosses in this FF are diverse, you'll fight a giant gelatinoid, an old spirit, and some gods beyond time-space.I've not found any glitch in the game, not a single crash, however sometimes it's dificult to switch to another window (I played in windowed mode), ... but ...  somehow switch to the ""task manager window"" is ""mandatory"" for the operating system. So, no problem at all.*** This game is not optimized for PC, if you have a low end PC it is certain that you will not enjoy this game. I have played in an AMD A8-Radeon R5 machine 15 fps (average).The game don't have graphics options to disable, the game always run at full antialias, shadows, illumination fx, etc. However, you can adjust some options in your Driver Settings... you will gain 5fps or so...Personally, I've enjoyed this game a lot .. so ..",Recommended,

It is the most annoyed game I ever played. I don't really know what was keeping me to finish it. But let's start from beginning.I need to underline that I hate writing negative reviews but FF XIII-2 leaving me no choice.FFXIII-2 is ""almost"" sequel to previous game of the franchise. In fact it is the same universe, and the same characters but the game actually doesn't have much to do with previously mentioned Final Fantasy XIII.First of all the bad aspect is about bad PC port. The game is jumping from 30 to 60 fps all the time, and even if you force to disable v-sync, then game works the same but with additional screen teering. In fact you can used to it anyway. But unmastared sound is something more than bad.There is no any option of voice, therefore in some scenes therefore very often the dialoges are drowned by music which is horrible!Yes, it's not a joke. I liked FF XIII becouse great soundtrack, almost like every game of the franchise, but THIS... Hey C'mon I really liked the song in the end but it doesn't mean i need to hear somebodys squaking through all the game. Some lokations have normal soundtrack and it was really spirit release to me.The story itself is rather average... There is nothing you could happy with or make you cry. I like Sarah, but as supporting character to main story, but not as a protagonist. Noel is even... well ok... I'll give break to noel. But I think the main problem of this game is lack of characters, that would make a great story.Graphics are ok. Infact they isn't great and its been about 5 years from the release, therefore there's no point to adhere to anything. It is just decent.What I actually liked, was a villain which was quite well described. I actually liked the main story, but it was covered with annoied mechanics.Sorry for bad review, i don't even want to right it, therefore it seems stupid, but if you don't have golden nerves, then i can't reccomend this game.

I like how the maps aren't just linear with small pockets that obviously hold item chests. I like the NPC interaction, even if it is just flavor. Overall, I think the addition of more explorable map areas is a vast improvement over FF13.My only beef is the controller. It says Partial Controller supprt, but I can play just fine with my controller... Except my left stick doesn't work, gotta use the D-pad. X=A. A=B. B=X. Y=Y.  LB and LT equal LB and RB, not sure which is which. Rt is RT, not sure what RB is or does yet.The controller misfires aren't that big a deal, once you figure them out, they might piss you off at the start, but once you get them down, it's alright. Haven't really had any framerates issues, a stutter here and there, but nothing I'm gonna get up in arms about.Overall I like this better than 13. Story is more engaging, world is more explorable, I just got into the meat and potatoes, if you will, of the combat, and I like it better. I like how the general combat system is the same, but the third party member tweak, and tuning, are what make it awesome. Graphics and soundtrack are pretty much what you would expect from a Final Fantasy title. In a word, Amazing.I'd give it 9/10 based on the three hours I've played so far.

The way they worked it into the Paradigm System, effing awesome. It let's you focus teh PC's one one or two roles, then use a Monster you've levelled to pick up the slack.

It's an interesting concept: travelling through time to try to change history, visiting alternate versions of the same places on different timelines - as well as the obligatory 'save the world' theme. Sure, it still has that slght repetitiveness that FFXIII had, but this time the world at least feels more open and not so much a 'walk down this corridor and fight lots of enemies ad infinitum' feel that its predecessor had.I know there are meant to be issues with the port, and my FPS fluctuates wildly between 20-60 all the time, but I can't say I've actually noticed any difference when it does (i.e. lagging or screen-tearing), so can't comment on the actual issues themselves.All in all, this is a more interesting game than FFXIII (minus some of its most interesting characters in Lightning and Fang, for me) and I'm looking forward to completing it so I can finally play 'Lightning Returns'.

Sweetz,52.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/,"March 4, 2016",0,"I outgrew liking JRPGs years ago now; they're too tedious and filled with too much nonsense...and yet I keep subjecting myself to them out of some oddly stubborn nostalgia and a kind of academic curiosity.While I didn't particularly like how FFXIII (the original) played and found the story filled with far too much gobbledygook to be compelling, I at least found things to like in some of the characters and the spectacle of it all (impressive cutscenes, settings, etc).FFXIII-2 is a game that I think fans of the genre would identify as better playing due to the more immediate access to its various systems.  However, it's still an absolute grind fest if you want to exploit the upper limit of what the game has to offer (extra hard optional bosses and such) - and if you don't, then the game is still more or less on autopilot just like FFXIII.As the gameplay doesn't appeal to me, what I've got left is the characters, story, and aesthetics - all of which I found lacking.  Noel and Sarah are little bland; the villain is much better, but they're all entangled in a story built of such nonsense that it's hard to empathize with any of them.  The settings and presentation don't compare to a proper full FF game either.On top of all that, there are few rather despicable elements to this game that seem to actively hate its players.  In particular, there's a casino in the game which has a slot machine - with odds of winning that seem barely better than real life.  Getting the game's bonus ""true"" ending is reliant (in part) on winning a big payout from this slot machine - something which is entirely random and no in any way influenced by player skill.  This is completely ridiculous.  It's the worst kind of creatively bankrupt time sink and completely disrespectful to players.  Even if I don't care about the bonus ending because I'll just watch a video of it, the mere presence of something as insulting as completion being tied to a random number generator casts a shadow over the whole game.  Finally, as noted by many other reviews, the performance is unacceptable to the extent that it does impact enjoyment of the game.  The game is internally locked to running either 30fps or 60fps because the gameplay engine is tightly coupled to the renderer and they hacked in 60fps support simply by halving the gameplay simulation speed and then only allowing the game to run at these two framerates instead of more sensibly decoupling the renderer from gameplay simulation.That still wouldn't be too be to bad if the game could maintain 60fps all the time, but even on hardware that should be more than sufficient to run the game at a solid 60fps (4790K and GTX 970), it will constantly jump between 30fps and 60fps depending how much is on screen.  The frequent changes in framerate are jarring and arguably worse than if the game was simply locked to 30fps.I'm going to suffer through it and see it to the end because I'm stubborn and compulsive about finishing games I start, but it's going to be a struggle for sure.",Not Recommended,

The biggest improvement in this game to me is that they removed the annoying paradigm shift animations from the first game.  If you played FF 13, you likely remember these.

YOU ARE MUCH BETTER OFF GETTING A USED COPY OF THIS GAME ON A XBOX 360 OR PS3 CONSOLE FOR CHEAP INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Note; I am not writing a negative review towards the game itself. From what I played so far with my few hours in this version, it's actually quite GREAT!! Obviously, the game takes place after the events of the Final Fantasy XIII and takes the original concept of XIII's game play and well... Pretty much sets it on fire.It throws away the linearity seen in the original and makes it entirely open and free to explore (although personally I didn't mind linearity at all.. And imho it actually fits the stories theme but that's just my personal preference.) as well as adding some new features to what's an already great combat system... One of the new features being is that you can now have POKEMON ON YOUR TEAM!!! ...erm, I mean monsters of course...BUT....There is just one thing wrong with this...IT'S THE PORT OF THIS GAME.. IT’S GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!! I was able to run the original game just fine with some minor issues here and there, but nothing too serious and was an overall enjoyable experience for me. However with this game, it runs terrible even though graphically the game is NOT any different as the orginal!! I keep on getting CONSTANT frame rate drops left and right, yet when I explore in some areas the frame rate runs buttery smooth. IT MAKES NO SENSE???Not only that, but the port also LACKS graphic options. The only options are just resolutions and anti-aliasing. SERIOUSLY!?!? This port is so bad that I had to download patches for the game that was made by the community, but even then the game still ran terrible. I understand that porting console games onto the PC is no easy task, but seeing this coming out from SE, this is unacceptable. I had to watch a ""movie"" version of this game onto YouTube instead, and it really made me sad seeing as how I'll never get the chance of actually playing this game.. Which is a huge let down.What's even worse is that this port has been out for an ENTIRE YEAR... AND SE HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!!Like I said, just get the console version of this game, or watch a ""movie"" version of this game like I did on YouTube.

Overall the level design is much better as they are way less linear and more interesting. Not to mention there is time travel and a ton of sidequests and alternate paradox endings to explore and find. The game has way more replayability than 13 and is a pretty big improvement on an already great game. English voice acting is still bad so I reccomend setting Japanese audio in the launcher.The ONLY DOWNFALL of this game is severe framedrops. Overall during battle my game plays @60fps but some specific cutscenes where 10fps. Most cutscenes and exploration played at 40-60 fps with a lot of fluxuations.

Mogwai,29.1,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039944628/,"January 20, 2016",0,"While I personally felt largely positive towards Final Fantasy XIII, this installment in the XIII series has left me feeling mostly frustrated and disappointed. Lightning was the focal point and poster girl of XIII but this time around you instead play as her sister Serah. Normally I’d have no problem with the idea of a spin off focusing on a different character however Serah was probably one of the least interesting characters in the original game and I was never really thinking “Hey, I sure would like to play as her”. Unfortunately the supporting cast is pretty lacking and the second member of your party “Noel” is nothing to write home about either. This also leads me to my next problem with XIII-2 which is that you only have two members in your party (the third slot being allocated to a monster of your choice). The plot is one of the most convoluted and dull time travel stories I’ve yet to see in a long while and at no point did this installment really ever feel warranted to me. The gameplay and progression is changed up a bit this time. The much criticized linearity of XIII has been somewhat remedied by adding branching levels which gives the player more options as to how they’d like to progress. The levels mostly feel pretty empty and dull with some nice scenery here or there. Lifeless npc’s inhabit most of them providing lackluster side quests to keep you from progressing too quickly. My biggest grievance however is that this port does not feel like it was given very much love or care. Your mileage may vary but even after installing an unofficial patch I suffered a lot of frame drops and low fps in the open world segments (however menus and battles mostly remained smooth). This doesn’t seem excusable when my PC is capable of running games like GTAV and The Witcher 3 on reasonably high settings at consistent frame rates. I was fortunately able to tough it out through most of the slower segments of the game. I should probably mention what I actually did like about the game. You get a lot of the same quality scenery and pretty cutscenes that you should be familiar with from XIII. It’s got the same easy and action based combat that I enjoyed from the last installment. The music is varied from the usual pretty tunes you expect from Final Fantasy to some perplexingly strange songs (Wild Chocobo theme, anyone?). The game doesn’t seem to always take itself too seriously which is fine by me. Be ready for some goofy anime nonsense. I could only really recommend this game on very particular circumstance. While this review is mostly negative I did however enjoy a good portion of my time with it and for the price I felt satisfied. It’s a pretty bad port and I’d imagine most wouldn’t have the patience to complete the game because of this. If the performance was improved I’d easily recommend it on the basis of an impulse buy during a sale however you may just be better off skipping this installment. There’s a lot of better Final Fantasy games on Steam.",Not Recommended,

For some people; this story might not be interesting, but it still have some fun parts to play with. I'll give it some examples:- First of all, one thing is not going change is this game has an excellent graphic, no doubt it. I can adjust the screen size resolution same as FF13 Lightning Returns up to 1920x1080p and shadow resolution up to 8120x8120 before the game starts, which is really high definition. I found when I put my shadow resolution into 8120x8120, everthing seems like too lagging, almost gone to frozen. I was not able to turn off game, then started panicking. After like 10 minutes, I shut down my PC and restarted again. Listen carefully, I can hardly to move the mouse to the shut down button. I found myself quite silly sometime, I should have made sure my PC can run that level before I go to adjust the resolutions. As a result, I just wanted to find that setting how high resolution my PC can handle itself.One thing I would like to suggest is making a game on a PC should have an Exit button, then player can go exit the game easily rather than clicking the window tab to go out to the window bar and close the game app or going into Steam app to play a game and closing the game on Steam app. Just my opinion sharing.- Second of all, I want to be clear I am not a spoiler, I just want to talk about the battle combat in this episode. In this episode, the battle combat still keep the old version of the function the most which I feel a bit not functional like Lightning Returns, it would be good to have some movements controling by the players, let players feel they're actually controling what Lightning is going to move next. At the same time, I found a new battle combat, which was Cinematic Actions"". I found Cinematic Actions quite fun to play with, it's also about testing how fast you can react. I think Cinemtic Actions makes you more exciting and what makes players to expect something that is cool and fun would happen. I have a thought of this Cinematic Actions, if this could put it into Final Fantasy 7, to me I think, it would be really epic! Myself quite like this kind of cinematic actions, it is also really making a game come to life. People like playing something different, such as something interact something move by using hand or joypad button or mouse, & VR Gear.- At last, this game is not bad, it has a lot of things and fun stuff to play.

Nenji Avero,30.0,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nenjiavero/,"December 21, 2015",0,"**Warning: Contains minor spoilers**Final Fantasy XIII-2 is one of those games where you spend hours doing stuff, but you usually don't really know what you're doing, or why you're doing it. Later, you find out, and the game gets more interesting.This game has some differences from the first part of trilogy, and it's got a nice pace. However, playing FF13-2 felt like I was playing a game that is completely unrelated to FF13.I can't put my finger on it, but something was bothering throughout the game. Don't get me wrong - I liked it, I liked it a lot. It's different than many FF titles in more than one way, but at the same time - it felt as if it's not really a Final Fantasy game. More like a game that borrows characters and some things from Final Fantasy, but is an individual game.The plot is weird, we all know that. Everything is in some kind of time-chaos, which leaves us to fix everything through lots of action, FMV sequences and dialogues. That's what we love about Final Fantasy, right? I liked the plot and the character progression. What I hated was the fact that I had very little chance to play with FF13 characters, since everything was revolving around the newcomer and Light's sister. Another thing I didn't like about the game was the limited focus on Alyssa's character, so her development seems a bit forced.The Battle system is very similar to FF13's, so everyhing is great until you come to the ""Cinematic Action"" parts of the game. It's frustrating and annoying, and should've stayed a feature in one of those old Spider-Man games. It has no place in a Final Fantasy title IMHO. Action is cool, and the battle-animations are great. Again, I would love to have seen more of the original FF13 cast, but Noel and Serah did a fine job too.Now that Lightning Returns has come to steam too, I will finally be able to finish this trilogy, and this makes me very happy. Playing through Final Fantasy XIII-2 left me with mixed feelings. Final Fantasy 13 is a game that I will surely play again some day, but I'm not sure I want to play 13-2 ever again. I'll be honest and say that I finished this game just for the story, and was not too interested in many of the side-quests (although I did some).Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a nice filler between FF13 and Lightning Returns, but playing this game I couldn't get rid of the ""sequel syndrome"". It's good, but not as good as FF13. I recommend the game to any Final Fantasy fan, and I think that players who are new to FF will like it as well.Don't play it if you love Counter Strike, Black Ops and Fallout. It's not that type of game, and you probably won't like it at all.My score: 8.2/10",Recommended,

I much preferred FFXIII to the sequel: many moaned that the original was far too linear, which is true, but it had a guiding plot and complex characters with interesting interactions. The sequel suffers from Time Gates (you don't know where/when you're going... means you can have no reason to 'GO' somewhere, you only ever get reasons to 'LEAVE') and only having 2 main characters plus a gimmicky Mog.Quick rundown of the characters:Serah: gets no character development from her supporting role in FFXIIINoel: cross between a cliche of a heartbroken teenager and a cliche of a boy with a fallen hero; neither is developed well. He's protecting Serah because he lost someone and wants to fight Caius because of anger... that's basically everything you get.Mog: ""oh isn't he cute..."" there, desired reaction achieved. Lightning: watch the trailer on the store page, look at the screenshots... that's about 50% of her presence in the entire game. I'd call her role a cameo but then I'd have nothing to say about Snow, Sazh, Vanille, Fang or the Nora gang...Hope: hey look, one of the original main characters made it intot he game in a meaningful way... too bad they took the most irritating of the characters and took him from an angry/lost kid to the ultimate boy genious. I'm assuming I wasn't the only one to miss the groundwork to suggest he wasn't just average intelligence... probably because it isn't there. He doesn't even get any noticeable character development: assume he's just a cliche child genious and you won't go far wrong.In fact Hope's role in this game is simply a lazy plot device... same goes for almost every solution to every part of every section of the game: do random things and the answer to your problem drops straight in your path. If they'd called this ""FFXIII-Deus Ex Machina"" I could have understood that, but as it is I just found it robbed any sort of unifying force to the story.",Not Recommended,

However I checked forums and found that updating my graphic card driver fixed the voice over lag significantly, with such little lag I only notice it in long cutscenes and if I pay close attention. Some have complained about in-game lag, and yes, it lags a good amount when too much is happening (especiialy ruinga spell), however for any FF fans this is no where enough of a reason to play this game. They have managed to create a sequel with a completely new feel to it. Though it is technicaly in the same world as FFXIII everything feels different, in a nice and refreshing way. The combat system is similar, though seeing how we had the same combat system for over 9 main FF titles, and this one is only shared with FFXIII, we cant complain at all. The story is amazing, the visuals are compelling, and the game may seem short at first but you quickly realised they have found an ingenious method to make a seemingly linear game into a game almost entirely based on side-quests, all which tie in well with the main plot.

To my dismay, they didn't improve upon it in the sequel. I was hoping they would have, but the game was on sale, so I took a shot. .....  I missed.......The game has a great story line. It is a little too full of fluff, but that is FF for ya. The biggest thing that turned me off about this game was the inefficiency of the portal. The graphics are usually just amazing in these titles, but I wouldn't recommend buying this from STEAM. The portal makes the graphics choppy, and their aren't too many things you can optimize to fix the issue. At times, the problem disuaded me from playing the game. This isn't something I should feel when playing Final Fantasy. I should be enthralled in the game with no disctractions, and enjoying a great interactive story. It didn't happen... so I suppose I will just have to go read a book instead.",Not Recommended,

danny_maland,50.7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988077759/,"August 16, 2015",0,"""XIII-2"" just barely crosses my ""Recommend"" threshold.It is, indeed, a ""Final Fantasy"" game. It has the requisite production values, large scope, interesting battle system, monster variety, and pretty much everything else you'd expect. Square Enix did well in taking a very different direction than the game's predecessor. The ultra-restricted linearity is gone, replaced with far more explorable environments - and, at a macro level, the ability to time hop. It doesn't get much more nonlinear than that.But the overall result is disappointing.When it all comes down to it, one of the central game mechanics becomes ""find and do as much as you can."" This kind of approach can be entirely functional and fun. It works wonderfully for the ""Mass Effects,"" ""Elder Scrolls,"" and ""Fallouts"" of the world. The problem is that ""XIII-2"" chooses to go the route of the 3D pixel hunt. That is, hints and direction are quite sparse, when they're around at all, and certain things (especially the Archylte Steppe) come down to a process of walking around every inch of an area you've already seen, hoping to run across something new. Which character offers quests? Who knows! What actually has an effect on this part of the gameworld? Who knows!The mixture is both boring AND frustrating, which is not a recipe for a happy player.Now, this kind of thing has been found in the ""Final Fantasy"" series before. It's just that it's very, very optional. Completing the game is usually about the core mechanics of character development and party management, with some very powerful goodies thrown in for the person who pokes their nose into everything. In ""XIII-2,"" poking your nose into everything is much more central to finishing the storyline - and that can make it rather maddening. The game suffers from a case of ""Guide Dang It"" (where you would never logically figure out an element from gameplay alone) more than any other ""Final Fantasy"" I've played.""XIII-2,"" like its predecessor, also has a case of a suddenly steep difficulty curve. You'll find a combat groove, and it will work all the way to the end of the game...and then the final battle occurs, and...looks like we need to go hunting around for more things in places we never thought to look! Let's try talking to everybody again. Again! While getting attacked by monsters the whole way! Again! Some more!Sigh.And then, you finally get to the ending, and it lacks any real payoff at all. (I can't say too much without spoiling things, but my reaction pretty much sums up as, ""They can't actually be serious about this, can they?"")As a final note, I have to say that I just dislike the whole ""time travel and alternate universes"" thing. It really worked for ""Dr. Who,"" but I find it thoroughly stale and disinteresting when used anywhere else. It seems to always turn into a case of ""we just want to throw a bunch of random stuff together, and so we'll explain it with TIME GATES!"" The game doesn't quite go that far - it is decently written - but my not being a fan of the central premise as a storytelling strategy doesn't make me want to award points to the title.In summary, ""XIII-2 "" really does improve on ""XIII"" in certain areas, but it's still more obtuse than it ought to be. Also, it REALLY hits some sour notes with how it wraps itself up. It was good enough to play through, but if ""Final Fantasy"" were a band, this would be one of the weakest albums in the catalog.",Recommended,

Overall I really enjoyed playing this game, and am still building up the monster's for fun! If you like RPG's you will probably like this game. It might help to know the previous story in 13 but honestly I had to re read most of it again since it's so complicated at times so really you can jump in at this game I think. You'll find the graphics are nice and the animations are good, its overall a very nice game to listen to and play but its not a very good FF game. Meaning that because its has FF in the front of its title its supposed to blow the doors off of the ride. Its just not that good. So if you like rpg's you'll find the game to be a mix of chrono trigger with time travel and tomb raider with exploration and finding VERY hard to find fragements that are shaded dark and transparent so have fun with that without a guide!The rest of the difficulty is just navigating the huge world where i feel it can slow the pacing. Old final fantasy games would frustrate me with the amount of battles and lack of story progress where as here the sheer size of the worlds to travel can take up time. there are chocobo's to speed things up but still... some maps are needlessly big. A common square enix complaint of mine. To much world not much interaction.The music is good but for its ups it has downs, i wouldn't play the ost front to back but playlist about half of it. Nice though overall.The battle system is where its at. This time you have only two character's,  aa bold rpg move, but you have a rotating monster to fill the third spot, this is fun but they are usually kinda weak untill late game so its helpful but sort of lacking as a real team member.The story is cool but why is time travel just now making an appearance in FF13 series? I don't think this is really all bad but it makes the world seem contrived and its just an odd feeling of the series being not a very well defined and formed rpg.They just make these ff games ont the fly these days without much real originality. Its a very manufactured rpg for your enjoyment but that's like a person who tries hard to be your friend and makes thier life choices around you. I would rather know they had a personality that was original and that I liked them... anyways i respect that they made improvements based on what we didn't like in 13... but why did they need to? Shouldn't they just make a good FF game that we are used to? Since 10 (the last true FF in many's opinion) its been all over the place and honestly just play this game as an RPG and put up with the Final Fantasy in the title as just a title not the gameplay hint.Sad but true, its still a good RPG and i reccoment it. Its very fun but very hard and the story is different but interesting albeit with very few actual characters. Most places have people in the towns but its not like they really are that interesting in my opinion. I feel like this is a very KOTOR Final Fantasy actually but that could just be me.If you like RPG's and action turn based combat get this one, its fun overall! If you like FF6 religiously try to take it in stride!",Recommended,
renodc,31.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Renodc/,"August 9, 2015",0,"First thing first: I would highly advise not playing this if you havent completed XIII already as while XIII is a game with serious flaws, the story of it will directly be spoiled in like the first half hour of this game.On the whole, I enjoyed the game. There are some underlying flaws but it left me with a positive experience playing through to the end. The plot is very hard to follow, in that sometimes it just doesn't make sense. It's a time travel plot but where usually with this type of plot, you change the past and the future changes, here everything changes including the past, as well as having a location and character in the opening sequence that falls out of 'time' and you arent really sure whats going on. The good? It look's pretty, even if things don't make sense .The battle system is probably the best disguise for a bad system I've seen in a long while. 'Auto Battle' command is back, which lets the CPU choose the best actions round by round. Personally I like to issue commands manually, only the thing is, to do so will put you at a huge disadvantage - manually issuing commands takes a couple seconds more while enemies still attack and prepare moves, and the commands are very generic (Attack, Magic attack, and four elements) for the most part. There are some battles with 6 enemies where I couldn't even tell what was going on, I found most battles I was glued to the HUD without looking at the graphics etc.You control one character while the AI controls the other, as well as a tamed monster you can have. I disliked this system too - it had potential but did a bad job of explaining what monster stats were, what benefit using monster A over monster B was, or even the fact it doesnt flag 'rare' monsters you encounter in the field up so you can easily pass them by.Character progression felt flat. You can level according to what you prefer, class wise, but by the end of the game you realise that in the end you will end up the same as every other player. As well, the points you put into the system to level up, dont seem to actually 'do' much. Partially realted to being glued to the HUD, you don't notice your characters scoring that massive crit thanks to their new stats/gear, because well, the numbers arent that impressive. Additionally the game seems to reward grinding and raw stats over strategy leaving many battles feeling unrewarding.The game is not linear, one of the main complaints many had with XIII. Did they take it a bit too far here? Maybe. I would say no, overall, however the tools you use to unlock extra stages or unlock special skills, or heck to even advance, were very difficult to locate in levels without the assistance of a guide. I didn't have too much issue finding my way to the end of the game, but then going back and trying to unlock extra stages or locate and capture decent monsters is impossible to acheive in any sort of decent time without a guide.Performance wise, it is a bad port, but with a few tweaks it is bearable, even fine if you have a good specced PC (I run it on an i7, GTX 770, and aside from a few frame rate drops it has been fine after tweaking using nvidia's own graphics settings.) There are no meaningful graphics settings in the games menu, so first thing you will want/need to do is google up some reccomended settings and then change these directly in your GFX cards manufacturers tool.Expect to get around 30 hours from the main story, and exploring side branches of the story reasonably well. Post game, FF fans may expect an uber boss, there are a few in this however as mentioned before, to even set about finding them, or preparing for them, you need a guide. If I'm using a guide to do everything I don't see the point in doing it, so I will likely complete some of the DLC and retire from the game. Overall the 30 hours have been enjoyable and I felt I have definately got my moneys worth,",Recommended,

Here are my pros and cons.Pros:Fun high paced style very different from previous FF games.Great animations and environments.Lots of freedom to explore and extra challenges to face.Good voice acting and excelent music.Cons:QTE finishers on boss monsters. I hate QTE sequences I'm sure some people love them just not for me.No limit breaks. Your monsters get limit breaks which can be mildly powerful but your characters don't get them they get these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ super spells that can only be used once a fight and do only slightly more damage than normal moves.Auto attacking is more effective than trying to cue up abilities manually. The fighting is too fast to navigate the menus and select the ideal combos (especially if you are hasted in a boss fight) and auto select does a decent job so why even bother?Only having two people is novel but I didn't like it. Requires grinding areas for rare monster crystals which could take tens of hours if you're unlucky.Story is hard to follow even for a time travel game.Limited customization in character leveling. (again only two characters and they can be maxed out pretty quick)No crafting or ultimate weapons.Capacity limit or status ailments makes good gear worse (better to stack delicate low level items for synergy bonus).Repetitive zones. It's cool you can go to the same place at different ages but it's the exact same map you play though 3 sometimes 4 times.No new monsters or bosses. Same exact monsters and abilities and differet time periods have the same mobs just a different color pallet.No fun mini games. The casino is dull the poker can only be played after the game is beaten and even then the opponents are predictable and no fun to play against. Slot machines are worthless.Ending sucks. No spoilers just know that the ending along with pretty much all the Pardox Endings are sh*tty.Final verdict.It was fun and I did throw a bunch of hours into the game collecting almost all the fragments and getting the various endings but the poor story, poor character development, and lame ending are all major turn offs.

The story feels like it can stand on its own for the most part, but a lot of stuff builds off of FF13 so it probably would be extremely confusing for a lot of the character's backstories/motivations/etc. if you haven't played FF13.The gameplay itself feels really solid. The combat feels a bit more refined than FF13 with the pet/monster system and the combat job system is a bit smoother and more streamlined than that of FF13. Your characters can fill pretty much any role you want without being gimped or it being impossible to upgrade them past a certain point for a given job, unlike in FF13. The way battles are initiated or avoided is also pretty cool and makes it a lot easier to avoid annoying enemies and a lot easier to plan against harder enemies. It feels like they took most of FF13's flaws and fixed them without making it boring.The game feels a bit too reliant on strategy guides for side quests though. FF13 was usually pretty easy to figure out or would at least have some clues as to what to do, but a good number of the side quests in FF13-2 feel like they need a strategy guide or just plain luck to find. I eventually reached the point I didn't care at all about the side quests after beating the main story. The main story is pretty easy to complete without referencing anything though.",Recommended,

The controls are clumsy, as you'd expect for a PC port; it seems weird not to get the map by pressing 'M' for example, but accepting that this is how it will be played, doesn't detract from the enjoyment.This is a must have for Final Fantasy fans, and a playable game for those new to the franchise.

CyberBinary,17.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CyberBinary/,"April 8, 2015",0,"Remember that like any modern Final Fantasy game, you may just hate it at first glance and I respect that decision.TL;DR below.Story-  This story is full of plot-holes and makes no sense.  Final Fantasy XIII's story is a Godsend in comparison to this.  Imagine Final Fantasy XIII's story but with time travel that goes against all of the modern time travel conventions.  It is really only there to get the characters together for a new adventure.  You should not be playing this game for the story.Exploration-  While still somewhat linear, there are hidden chests placed throughout the world that you can find.  You are also able to accept quests in the field.  Completion of these quests will cut down on grind time because they give you EXP (Crystarium Points).  You can travel between the different areas of the game in the Historia Crux, a menu showing all of the points of time you can travel to.  This menu allows you to reset areas, battling bosses again and gathering treasures you might have missed.  Enemies show up at random on the field, but you are given a short period of time to run away from them or get an early attack on them.Combat-  In combat, you have a bar that is split into several segments that fills over time.  Battle commands can be attached to the segments of the gauge.  You can choose to use the entirety of your gauge at once, or use moves as the bar fills up.  Serah and Noel can be assigned classes and switch between these classes in combat.  This is where the meat of the battle strategy comes from.  You are able to have a Pokemon-esque monster accompany you in battle.  This monster also has a class which will help balance out your team.  The way the class system works still goes over my head, but I think that combat is enjoyable nonetheless.Optimization- This game will run like garbage on YOUR PC.  I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE A TITAN X, THE GAME IS JUST BROKEN.  EXPECT 30 FPS AT ALL TIMES.TL;DR, like most modern Final Fantasy games you will endure it or you will hate it.  The story is meaningless, but the gameplay is enjoyable.5/10 mediocre, would bluescreen while playing again.",Not Recommended,

Of course, it's a time paradox based story so you'll find as many plot holes as you want to, but I'd say the writers watched a lot of Doctor Who and it looks decent enough to be enjoyed.- The main paradox in the story is just great, with a Doctor Who style resolution. Awesome.- Real choices with corresponding alternate endings which make sense. - The two main characters are annoying and mean good but don't really know what they are doing. Clever. Lightning on the other hand is the best character from the XIII series by far, and they found a nice way to keep her busy while making her look good.- Good combat system, slightly improved from XIII.- The way the side content is blended with the main story (you have to do side missions at some points in the story, explore timelines a bit randomly, etc).- Lots of side timelines and additional missions.- Lots of content.Bad:- Could use a few more locations and one or two major paradox plots in the main story.- Some important side content is gratuitously hard to find without guides (wild artefacts locations ...).- Too grindy to complete the endgame content.- Confusing character advancement (read guides).- The third character in the party are monsters which can be swapped. Nice, but again too grindy and impossible to use correctly without reading wikis and guides. Although they tried to find something original and it's a decent attempt, a regular character would have been better.- Graphics and textures are a big downgrade from XIII.

InappropriateCPT,100.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975396902/,"March 4, 2015",0,"Part 2 of the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy starts off fast and gets right into things. The story is nicely carried over from the first XIII title and is generally presented pretty well. We return to familiar faces, along with some new ones.The story starts off quite confusing and you are given tons of info pretty quickly. It may seem messy at first due to alot of unexplained events and the time travel aspect can mix things up a little further. However time travel in XIII-2 is mostly used as a way to get the game world to be opened up a bit and to move away from the linear direction that was FFXIII, from this point of view its done well and doesnt really pose any issues. As the story goes on it gets really intense, i found myself at the edge of my seat a few times.The graphics for the most part seem to be slightly improved over the first game and are really enjoyable. The battle system is fantastic. Its simular to XIII with a bit of a twist with things like the mog clock, allowing you to start off a battle with haste if timed well. There is also the addition of pets and they act as the third member in your party. The Crystarium System is more streamlined and works really well.The performance for some reason isnt as good as XIII and i find myself getting very varied frame rates, this should not happen on a 4000 dollar PC that was purchased in 2015. Overall its not too much of a problem, however it certainly doesnt go unnoticed and its worth mentioning. Hopefully they improve on this for Lightning Returns.Boss fights feel very rewarding and fun. Encounter mechanics are fresh and interesting, this game has one of the most memorable final boss fights ive experienced in ages. There is a fair amount of grinding needed to be done to down the final boss but nothing too crazy, the progression feels right, they really nailed it here. There is a great addition of skins in XIII-2 that are taken to the next level in Lightning Returns, something that i rate very highly as i love customization in any game.There is a lack of CG cutscenes in XIII-2 i would have liked a little more than the 2 or 3 they did for the game.Overall i found FFXIII-2 to be a fantastic sequel that is a must play for anyone that enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII, you get the chance to delve further into Lightning and Serah's story, I cant wait to jump into Lightning Returns, this might be one of the best game trilogies ive played, infact this game was the reason i will continue to invest my time and money into the franchise and purchase a PS4 to contine the legacy that is Final Fantasy.Would thank Square Enix again and again and again for porting this to PC.9/10",Recommended,
PickleOh,62.7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Titantic/,"March 2, 2015",0,"I've always been a big fan of Final Fantasy games, even their most recent games. I've purchased VII, VIII, and XIII on Steam. the XIII games have had problems being ported so far, but the problems for XIII have been addressed for the most part, and it runs excellently! XIII-2 on the other hand, runs like a dead raccoon. There appear to be some CPU performance issues due to the game being a port from the PS3 version, with the abnormal CPU they put in that console. The game runs fine out in the world, the minimap instantly reduces fps from 60 to 30, disabling it boosts back to 60 right away. Upon opening the menu to equip items, change Paradigms, etc, the fps drops to a solid 20. I know that fps don't seem too important but with the amount of monsters to scroll through the low fps becomes a pain. Getting to the worst thing, in battle, I don't see fps higher than 15. Upon entering the battle, I have a solid 60 fps, but as soon as the battle menu HUD comes up, it drops and sits at 15, not going lower or higher than that. FFXIII menu also has an effect on fps, but not one this great.

Rtype77,60.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198092028653/,"February 21, 2015",0,"I've completed most of the main Final Fantasy titles: III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, X-2, XII, XIII and now I'm playing this.Ok, there are my FF player credits. Now I am going to ""rant"" more about this game in-detail. STORY/ART STYLEI wasn't a big fan of the thirteenth instalment in the series. That said, in retrospective, I think I actually like it story-wise more than XIII-2. Why? Because of the time travel element! The wisdom I once heard: ""Usually, when a time travel plot element is involved, it tells that the story writers were desperate."" That seems to be the case in some parts of the story. While the story seems much clearer so far in the game, initially, when you first start, the concept of time traveling seems to do nothing but confuse with all the feeling-based concusions about the future and the past. You are given a simple goal: get from point A to point B, and the ""road"" to there is all tangled up. Sort of.Remember FFX-2? It was supposed (?) to be a direct sequel, sure. However, it was a whole different game! There's sort of a stigma associated with direct sequels to Final Fantasy games and it sure made my expectations lower for this ""direct sequel"", too. The plot? with all the ""kupo! look-at-me-i'm-so-cute"" and some painfully slow and outright boring parts aside, I have so far enjoyed the idea of finding Lightning and untangling the tangles. I think I will finish the game (once). I'm not very fond of the violin-piano-la-la-la-remember-my heart-la-la-female vocalist faintly singing type of a thing, as it seems very ""girly"" or overly romanticized and overused in the universe of FFXIII. I do, however, like few of the battle themes and how the track intensifies when monsters appear on the field.The characters? We see three kind of character behaviour in this game:1) Characters state the obvious. and do it again.2) Characters don't know a thing3) Characters (Serah infamously so) become quantum scientists; they pull wild, speculated theories out of the thin air that turn out to be truth.Usually in the following pattern:  1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 -1 - 1 -1 -1GAMEPLAYWithout a doubt, combat and leveling up are my salt and butter in this game. Just like in FFXIII, I find it satisfactory to level up the crystarium and watching the stats go higher. I like the paradigm system as it makes it possible to ""stagger"" the otherwise ridiculously strong opponents and beat them up with the right set of paradigms.I am not entirely satisfied with few things:Mog throwing? ugh. A nice idea, but the implementation is not quite there.Mog clock? In few places of the game, the enemies ""chase"" you and the mog clock turns red. The problem here is, the enemies are no where to be seen! This means, you are forced into combat with no retry option. How convenient. The gameplay really drags the story in some parts. Some dungeon hallways are so narrow that you are practically forced to fight battles every few meters. The same things with fast and aggressive enemies in some dungeons. Luckily, the dungeons seem short, which seems to balance this out a little.Performance issues: the game seems to lag here and there and the gameplay seems capped at 30fps for the most of it. I am running the game on a decent ""gaming"" rig:i5 3570k @ 4ghzgtx 970 4gb12 gb ddr3 ramThe performance definitely could be better. At 1080P 8x AA, The graphics card barely gets a challenge. Seems like this game is more CPU intensive.And by no means my cpu is a slouch.Long story short: I'm glad I bought it on sale! I SAY DO IT!+ If you're a final fantasy fan (not hardcore level) like me and out of curiosity want to play through the game at least once+ you liked FFXIII+ If you are a hardcore ff fanI SAY NO WAY IN H***- If you are new to the series- if you haven't completed FFXIII prior to playing this7/10 story so far8.5/10 battle system",Not Recommended,
The Dragon Ace,50.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDragonAce/,"February 21, 2015",0,"A great sequel to FFXIII, that improves and expands on FFXIII in some terrific ways. Pros:• Better Plot: I found the story in FFXIII-2 to be easier to follow than FFXIII's plot. • Less Serious Tone: More lighthearted moments throughout the story. Moogle had quite a few funny moments.  • Less Linear: There are multiple pathways in most levels with hidden loot. • Less Grinding: The harder encounters are usually optional, so you don’t need to grind as much. • More Freedom: Can choose where you want to travel to and what content you want to do. • Dialogue Choices: A great addition, that was nonexistent in FFXIII. • Great QTE Events: I usually hate QTEs but FFXIII-2 does a good job of making the QTEs feel appropriate, without overdoing it. • Interesting DLC: Lightning and Sazh’s side stories were particularly engaging to play through. Cons:	• Dull Side Quests: Quest design is not that interesting, and usually involves a lot of backtracking. • Limited Characters: There are only 2 characters and 1 monster in your party.

Fawkzi,9.9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/crymzen/,"February 17, 2015",0,"TL;DR: It feels like DLC turned in to a full game but there are major improvements/changes that make it interesting enough to warrent a purchase. The graphics seem worse than XIII yet the assets look like they were pulled directly from the previous game. The story is the weaker element, not as good as XIII yet the gameplay improved on everything that was annoying about XIII. It's a good title, it holds up as it's own game but it's not something that will keep you hooked.(I jumped right in to XIII-2 just moments after finishing XIII so comparisons will be made between the two, this review will concentrate on the changes made from XIII to XIII-2 as the games are so similar that if you did like XIII then you will most likely enjoy this.)It feels like DLC turned in to a full game, What i mean by this is that it feels like they had a cool idea to play as Serah in an expansion to XIII but opted to turn it in to it's own game, This is common in the industry (Just take a look at Saints Row 4, it was originally a DLC for Saints Row The Third)With that being said  it IS a fun game to play though at first glance it is misleading, With Lightning's character model and face plastered all over the place it is easy for one to think that she is the focus of the game, she is in a sense but not in the playable kind, she is the starting focus of the story.Serah is your playable character in this game, a long with a boy called Noel. Graphics wise it actually looks worse than the original XIII to me but that could be down to the port itself. Gameplay wise itis more of the same only they scrolled things back a bit in terms of enemy encounters.You can no longer see the enemies in full view as you could in XIII, encounters work on a detection system where enemies will randomly appear as you are running around, you can either try to run or attack them. It's a sort of ballance between the way encounters worked in XIII and how encounters worked in the old school games.The combat system as been revamped somewhat though it does feel a hell of a lot slower (even when using the haste ability) One of the major improvements is ability to switch party leader mid battle, this also means that the battle is not over if your current party leader goes down in battle, it simply switches to the next person so you can continue the fight.The major update though is the addition of monsters, you can now ""Tame"" monsters you encounter (Through no special mechanic, you simply beat a monster and sometimes it will drop a crystal wich adds that monster to your collection) These monsters act as your third party member in combat, each one having a specific role from the same pool of character roles that you saw in XIII.These monsters can not become party leader and have the same behavior as any AI set in whatever role it happens to be in but with a unique twist. every monster has it's own special attack which can be used by incrasing the ""Feral Link"" gauge, this gauge works very similar to the ""Gestalt"" and ""TP"" gauge from XIII. Once full you can activate a special attack which then starts a QTE to determine a damage boost to said attack via a ""Sync Level""How fast you complete the QTE prompts determines your Sync percentage which determines the damage boost for the attack, each monster has it's very own unique attack each with different attributes.The leveling system has also changed a fair bit, the Crystarium is back but in a different way, rather than all roles having their own seperate progression track all roles are now on the same track which i honestly do prefer because ""Builds"" are now a viable option. The Crystarium also expands automatically rather than in key points of the story, once you reach the end of what is currently available the track will then expand, you can then pick a bonus. The bonuses are pretty cool, you can pick a boost the roles you have unlocked, unlock a new role or increase your accessory capacity. The Crystarium is also available for your monsters, though you can not use ""CP"" to upgrade them, instead you use componants to progress them but it still works in the same way..the main difference beign you can not change the role of a monster, each monster has it's own set role an dunique progression track.They made a big change to the way you equip accessories, in XIII you started with one slot and unlocked more as you progressed, here you start with three and can still unlock more except now you have a capacity, each accessory has a number next to it, for example a ring has a value of 55, your capacity is 70, if you want to equip a second accessory you will needd to find one that doesn't go above the remaining capacity, example case being 15. Your capacity can of course be upgrade via the Crystarium expansion bonuses.All in all it is a decen entry, far from being the best and story wise it isn't as good as XIII but Gameplay wise it adds enough new mechanics to edge ahead of XIII. It's worth it for the price, give a try.",Recommended,
Razi,52.3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raziadastra/,"February 16, 2015",0,"FFXIII-2 is such a good game that it almost makes me like FFXIII in retrospect. Almost.First, let's just get the elephant in the room out of the way: yes, this port is terribly optimized. It may work fine for some, but I played at 30fps with drops, with is really pretty abysmal. The only thing this has over playing on console is resolution and the ability to use the Japanese audio. The Japanese audio, by the way, is fantastic.So now on to the good. I played through FFXIII and really hated the experience by the end and still consider it the worst entry in the franchise. Then this game comes along and basically fixes every problem I had with the original.- Paradigm switching is now instant! A no brainer change, really, but it changes the pace of battle so much when you don't have to watch the camera stupidly focus in on every party member one at a time for each paradigm shift.- You can now tame wild monsters and have them fight along side you. This not only goes a long way towards offering the player choice in how to compose their party early on, but it's also just a lot of fun finding badass or adorable monsters and taming them.-The game just generally utilizes the game mechanics much more. I was forced to rapidly switch between paradigms and change up my party compositions SO much more than the original.-Boss fights typically include QTE's to finish off the fight. Some might take issue with this but I liked them and it made beating bosses feel really satisfying. Reminded me of Bayonetta.-Enemies no longer appear in the field all the time, but rather randomly show up in circle around you as you walk around. This isn't reeeaaally a positive or negative change, but what IS better is that you now have a dedicated attack button to get the drop on enemies instead of runnung around in circles like an idiot tryng to run into enemies from behind like in the original. -Actually, there is a negative to be mentioned here: difficulty spikes. I have no problem with challenging games but when a section or boss comes out of nowhere and just wipes the floor with you repeatedly it tends to raise an eyebrow. This thankfully only happened to me twice (once in the middle, and then final ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy boss), but it was more than a little annoying.The original game had you do 2 things and 2 things only: walk forward and fight enemies. FFXIII-2 not only gets you up and running with all the game mechanics MUCH quicker, but generally has a greater amount of variety in it's gameplay, including:- Actual sidequests! And lots of 'em! - NPC's to talk to and interact with! Lots of those too!- Branching pathways and areas that aren't a simple straight line! - Monsters to tame and level up! Fight with a chocobo at your side!- You have an adorable Moogle companion who you can throw (yes, throw) to reach far away treasure. A small but hilarious addition.- The crystarium has been changed. It's still a pretty linear affair, but every time you fill up a full grid or screen or whatever, you can choose a big reward like adding a new section to the ATB guage or even unlocking a new role.- I was completely sick of most of the characters in FFXIII by the time I was through with it. Serah and Noel are, thankfully, handled in a much better fashion. I found Serah to be likeable from the get go,  and while her motivations aren't really that deep (""I just want to see my sister again!"") she's characterized really well and her sincerity is really charming. Then Noel is like FF's version of Riku, minus the being a d*ck to the main character part. Both have really solid voice acting whether playing in Japanese or English.- This game is also pretty dark, which might not be what you expect from looking at it. The farther and farther into the future you travel the more hopeless things become. This sense of desperation, to me, is the heart of Final Fantasy.- On a similar note, the time travelling is a lot of fun. Seeing how the world and characters change depending on what time period or even timeline they're in is really interesting. There's a good chance you'll get sick of hearing the word ""paradox"", though. You've been warned.- The soundtrack is phenominal. The original certainly wasn't dragging it's feet in this department but I feel like it fell a bit short of pulling off a ""different"" sounding FF score. XIII-2 absolutely pulls it off. The three composers have put together an awesome collection of beautiful tracks ranging from the classic FF sounds, to some more electronically infused numbers and,  best of all, a handfull of tracks that include vocals. The New Bodhum theme alone sets this score apart.- The game's a looker, no doubt about that. Special mention goes to the animation however, as I think Square is really great at animating their characters and especially faces.There is one more negative however, and that's how the game handles it's ending. To see the ""real"" ending you have to play a (thankfully included) DLC chapter that is incredibly tedious and feels entirely divorced from the whole experience. It's weird that Square would get such a huge amount of things right in this game and then bork up the delivery of the ending. Yeah. Just weird.That aside, I can't recommend this game enough. If you already liked the first, then you robably didn't need any convincing anyway, but if you are like me and hated the original, then I have to urge you to give this one a shot. It's not often that a studio puts in this much effort into fixing a game, so when they do I think they deserve to be rewarded.",Recommended,

WHY DOES THE 2D HUD CAUSE MY FRAMERATE TO TANK SO HARD!?The best solution I've found is to unlock the fps via a .exe mod discovered by FF community members and then forcing a 30fps cap.

It all fixed in this sequel where some of the npc can be talked with and asking you a request to accept mission.+Cinematic action: while you're watching some of the cinematic sequence, there's cinematic sequence that requires you to push some of the button that'll be displayed.+Graphics: The graphics was pretty well done. For example I can see the rain drops into the monitor screen while the weather are raining.+Music: One of the famous aspect of this game was the music, it's lovely to hear it especially the battle soundtrack.Overall I rate this sequel 8.5/10 and recommend this if you have play the previous one.",Recommended,

Fantasy,97.2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FantasyCloudNinja/,"February 8, 2015",0,"About the Story:Haven't played FFXIII but could follow the Story in FFXIII-2 because of the fact that you can read the Story from the first Game in the second from Chapter 1 to 13, which was really great, because the Story in XIII-2 could be a lil bit confusing without if you are really willing to follow the story.About the Collectables:There are 160 fragments which you can get from Sidequests or just by finding them, they will unlock some extra abilities like when you jump, you can jump further by holding the button. The Monster Combat System:You can *catch* some monsters like Tonberry, which will fight beside you and your other team mate. Each monster have different abilities and special abilities, which they will learn by leveling them up via monster materials (different from leveling your characters). You can also infuse a monster with another monster to get them their abilities like +XXXstrength.(This will delete the infused monster, but you can still get it back by catching it again).Linear Gameplay yes/no?:I can pretty much say that this game isn't linear at all, you can do whatever you want to do once you entered the first episode. If you do not want to follow the story part, then you can just do some sidequests or search for items. Of course there are some sidequests which will get unlocked after finishing the game, but still good for people who do not want to follow the story immediatly.Does this game have long time motivation?:In my opinion, this FF is really enjoyable even if you already have beaten the game. I was at the final boss in like 29 hours, but decided to do some sidequests and then beat the boss after a total of 44 hours. Also I already played over 50+ hours after finishing the game, because there are some things like the Coliseum, which can pretty much take your time pretty fast. The bosses there are some well-known FF bosses and are challenging if you do not know or have tactics to defeat them.Also... you can play poker as Sazh... that is.... awesome? :PNegative thingys?:Yes, there is one thing which is negative.Sometimes the FPS goes to like 20...BUT I did and I do not care if it does. You should totally play this game!Overall:Almost 100 Hours of playtime and still 3 bosses left + 7 collectables. Fav. FF so far with FFX :3!",Recommended,

dh_dm2000,0.9,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968380666/,"February 8, 2015",0,I was very disappointed with the style of combat. I was hoping for something like kingdom hearts and instead got a bad mix on old school final fantasy. It does all of the battling for you. All that is needed is just somewhat timed buttons press and a shift in battle strategy when needed. Yes to can do so manual stuff but the combat is way too automated for this day and age or at least my taste. You really buy this game for the story and to be honest I would want to watch the movie and not do the grind. Not worth the 9.99 I paid for the game.Some tipIf you are a fan of the style of fight in Final Fantasy I would recommend:-getting a USB Xbox 360 control for your PC (You will have to figure out the controls but it is not hard and everything is mapped)-Had a good graphic card.

I liken this game more similarly to Chrono Trigger due to the time traveling mechanic (a good thing!) and it adds a lot of complexity and depth to solving puzzles and resolving events. If I were to have any complaints it would be that some elements can be exceedingly grindy trying to farm certain items to level up your party, but it's a minor nitpick at an otherwise amazing game.

hexagon,12.5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hawxegen/,"February 8, 2015",0,"Final Fantasy games have always been tied together by common motifs: crystals, summons, Chocobos, airships, and Yoshitaka Amano's Klimt-esque concept art. In Final Fantasy 13, both towns and exploration were discarded as extraneous trappings, unnecessary to Lightning's mission or - as it was referred to in the game's terminology - her Focus. In 13-2, however, the towns are back with sprawling areas filled with people to talk to for tackling on side quests. In my opinion 13-2 recaptures what was lost in the series's heritage. 13-2 is a game about time traveling, and multiverses. Searh Farron, the main protagonist of this game, is on a quest to search for her lost older sister, Claire Farron.  The idea of including monsters/pets to have their own development trees and can be named, dressed and even fed other captured monsters in order to inherit their abilities is amazing. The customization of developing your characters on a molecular level, then at a squad composition level, can be immensely satisfying. I run this game on high settings, 1080p at average of 50-60fps; however, the fps dips down to 30 in combat, which is bareable. I wish there were more graphics options to tinker with to make this game, but for a console port it is manageable. 8/10",Recommended,

If you look at the forums, these seem to be widespread problems across all kinds of gaming rigs and settings (with no readily apparent solutions), so I feel pretty confident in saying that this is not a problem with my setup. I've spent twice as long trying to fix this game as I have spent playing it, and that's just not a fun experience.It's really sad, because the parts of the game I've seen so far have been very compelling.

This game takes the incredible story of the original (including the lengthy cut-scenes!) and continues it on a path filled with complex time-travel paradoxes which I'm still not convinced make complete sense.Otherwise, it's definitely worth picking up for any fan of the series. I did feel however that the changes made to the battle and crystarium systems were a little unnecessary and didn't work quite as well as those in the original.Despite being a lot more open and free-roaming than the original (which is commonly referred to as a corridor simulator because of its linearity), this game is approximately half the length of the last, but does offer lots of replayability if you so desire.It's also worth mentioning that this game does thankfully contain the advanced graphics options that were recently introduced with XIII, but does unfortunately suffer from the same performance issues manifested in some pretty serious dips in framerate. The game dosn't come anywhere near being considered as unplayable because of it, it's just something to bear in mind if dropping below 60FPS angers you.Overall, a very solid Final Fantasy game overshadowed slightly by its predecessor, but not enough to stop me from being keen to play the finale to the trilogy when it releases on Steam.PS.

The story is probably one of the selling point of this game, it's way better than ff13 and it's interesting. The boss fights are too few and too easy.

Combat got some nice tweaks: you can change leader in a middle of a fight and add almost any monster in your party. But the best part - developers stopped to threat players like idiots and you'll get access to most features almost from the start.Ofcourse there are some bad things. Enemies appear randomly, just like in classic FF games. And some side quests (for example gathering data on all existing monsters) are practically unfinishable without reading guides (another trademark of classic FF games).Story starts exactly where 13 ends so playing prequel before 13-2 is a must (there is a ""beginners primer"" in the main menu, but its hardly enough). So, the story... one of the game's features is time travelling, and its even more confusing (at first) and even more epic than before. There are only 2 main characters this time (instead of 6 in FF13) so developers could develop them better and make player more attached to them.

It's a unique final fantasy, and also quite different from XIII. It retains most of the positive elements of XIII (such as an excellent battle system) while avoiding the linearity that XIII was panned for. In addition to being much more linear, the story is far easier to follow. This speaks volumes about the over complication of XIII, that its sequel about time travel is easier to follow. However, with the added freedom of exploration, it's lost some of the focus that XIII had. Also, I don't like the soundtrack as much. Too much J-pop for me.

AWESOME! Much better story, sidequests, amazing soundtrack, time travelling. First I was a bit sad, that there are only two characters (in FF games I really like to change the partymembers frequently), but storywise it was understandable, and by the end of the game I got really attached to them. After FFXIII, this game is a huge step forward and I can't wait for Lightning Returns!",Recommended,

Really dont like the soundtrack at all, some maps has really good soundtrack some just terrible/annoying overpower female singing in background (Whoever approved to put those OSDs on should be absolute fired). Yeah, its okay to hear it for like 5mins, but it keeps on and on when you are exploring the map and quests ---> gets real annoying. Thanks god, they still keep the ""Blinded by light"" OSD ^^ in this game. More chocobo riding which is awesome, you dont have to walk like crazy in F13.

VitalSuit,31.8,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vitalsuit/,"December 19, 2014",1,"Short review but here it goes (don't expect a lot of detail out of this)Pros: -A lot less linear than FF13-Combat is more or less the same with some tweaks-Japanese and English voices, swap between them in the launcher before starting up the game (subtitles are only for the English script though so some of the sentences are way off when using ♥♥♥ voices)-Characters are tolerableCons:-Lightning (although to be fair she's far less annoying than in FF13)-Snow-Only 2 party members throughout the entire game and a large selection of monsters that you can tame through battle as your 3rd party member-Even though this game is less linear than FF13 it still feels like a mishmash of sidequests and the story feels very disjointed-Performance is awful, one minute you'll be at 60fps and the second you step into town your FPS will drop to 30 and not budge. I doubt it's my PC and it seems to be an issue with the game's coding for consoles or something.In all I do recommend the game but seriously the performance is terrible and it was getting on my nerves throughout the entire playthrough. If you were one of the people that had major issues with FF13 (the game in general not just the PC port) then DO NOT GET THIS GAME as this is pretty similar (duh) and any rabid FF fans will tear this game apart.",Recommended,

Ascended,19.4,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045421292/,"December 18, 2014",0,"I would personally recommend Final Fantasy XIII-2. The game itself is much better than XIII,  the game is no longer stupidly linear and is actually fun to run around the different areas/time zones, as opposed to running down a corridor. The monster system is pretty cool, having the ability to choose monsters to be part of your party, and leveling them along with the main characters. The shop is actually not bad now, and is something you might use often. They also smartened up with the battle system, so now when the leader dies, you don't lose the battle, which was the dumbest thing ever. There is a lot more things to the game than just this, but these are some of the things I really liked in the 13 hours I've played at this point.The PC version of this game is... in need of work. Granted XIII-2 Launched with graphics options, which is awesome, the game fells like it stutters a lot more, and has more frame drops than XIII did. My computer is very high end, and should not have any troubles with any game like this, but for whatever reason, it does. If they can fix it somehow, and make it so computers good enough get a constant 60FPS, it would make this game just that much better.Overall, I would rate the game a 8.5 I'd say at this point, and the port a 5. It is a fun game, so I can put up with the sometimes bad performance.",Recommended,
Gravity Beetle,76.4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jamboframes/,"December 18, 2014",0,"I played the PS3 version of this multiple times as it is my favorite of the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy.  The PC port is disappointing.  The game itself is just as good as ever, and so I do recommend the game, but the current state of the port is just lazy.  Seems like Square did enough work to make it play on a PC and said ""Ship it!""I'm playing on a i5-4670K overclocked to 4.4ghz with a GTX 770.  I can play a game like Battlefield 4 at very high quality settings and get > 100 fps.  This game struggles to maintain 30fps.  It struggles in the strangest way, in that I'm standing in an area, rocking a smooth 60fps, turn a little or wiggle the camera and the rate drops to 30fps.  While watching CPU and GPU usage during this time, nothing really changes.  The game just decides to stop doing more than 30fps.  This would be slightly less annoying if it were locked at 30fps, but it isn't, so it looks like little micro-stutters as the rate toggles between 30 and 60.  Doesn't matter the settings I play at, and I've tried all of the random tweaks someone on the forum swears worked for their friend's dogsitter's cousin to no avail.",Recommended,

Kobiax,70.6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kobiax/,"December 17, 2014",0,"Compared to the other FF games -- This game is annoying beyond belief.  I couldn't recommend this game unless you just flat out loved FF13.  Then, afterwards you would have to continue on with the story.  If you're a newbie to the FF realm I'd avoid this one and instead of the older ones if you're a hater of bad graphics I'd move to FF10 if they ever release it on PC.  If you're not -- then I suppose FF7 or FF8 would be a good place to start.This game has a complicated, yet simple story at the same exact time.  If you choose to follow it through to its conclusion you'll understand.The annoying thing is its non-battle (yet considered battle) system that they employed in this game.  I don't want to have to look at my keyboard while I'm doing a cgi sequence.  I WANT to watch the cgi sequence.  That's what Square is known for is cgi sequences.  Although it starts off slow the plot eventually ends up being good.  Not the best FF story of all time, but it's far better than most video game devs give their RPG stories.I know the story is going to have a conclusion once FF 13 Lighting Returns is released, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know as a first timer to the FF series to get them involved in it due to the story line.Graphics - 7/10Plot 7/10Battle System - 7/10Voices - 8/10Price Value - 8/10Time travel system - 3/10Music - 7/10Length (compared to other video games now days) 9/10Overall - 7/10",Recommended,

For those who didn't play the first one, there is a Summary of every chapter of the first game although I highly recommend you to play XIII first.Regarding gameplay it is quite similar to the first one: The Battle System has with the ability to tame monsters a greater variety in comparisone to before. Also the leveling system allows a more individual set up.The gameplay got less linear, there's a ton of optional stuff to do, you can play minigames etc. You even get the DLCs for free (you shouldn't miss Requiem of the Goddess: Lightning's story when you've played through the game)Soundtrack and music (including new tracks and some of the first part) are as always fantastic.The story mainly introduces new characters, so the events and characters of the first game are mainly issued as backgroundinformation. This time around the story really might be a little confusing at the beginning but as soon as you get into it it's ok and for myself I enjoyed it.*MINOR SPOILER*Although XIII-2 pretty much scrambles up the ending of the first game and the ending of the sequel itself leaves you wanting more because of that damn open and baiting ending, I found the story really interesting (10/10 thumbs up if u cri ;o evrytiem at the end of XIII-2).*END OF MINOR SPOILER*For this price and the amount of content this is a must buy!Don't listen to all those hardcore retro hipster fanboys of the old Final Fantasies, the Final Fantasy XIII series is really worth playing and as good as its predecessors.->BUY DIS GAME!",Recommended,

How is it possible that I can run NEW games on High to Ultra, yet get 9-30 FPS on this game, one from years ago? Not to mention the graphics are so fuzzy, it looks like somebody enabled FXAA antialiasing for a program that doesn't require it. Even using NVIDIA control panel to give a performance boost does ZERO to help increase FPS. Regardless of whether you play the game with x16 MSAA, or x2, you receive the same FPS. Same with the shadow quality slider option. If anything, it ran slightly smoother with maxed graphics quality than lesser. Not to mention the audio is all over the place. Voices are too loud in cutscenes, too soft everywhere else, and there is no in-game slider to balance it out. Once (or IF) patched and stabilized, it will be as much fun as it was for the PS3. If it doesn't receive the needed patches/updated optimizations, steer clear of this game for the PC.[Updated - 12-16-2014]After clearing the very first area, the fps improved by 10, which is apparently a huge deal for this particular game. Game is now playable at a constant 20-30 fps, with the only increase over that being 50-60 for menu/blank loading screens.Idk what all was going on graphically in the first area, but it must have had some serious graphic drainers. Hopefully they patch this game eventually like how they did with FF13's fps stability update. Adding an ingame option to change the various sound levels would be nice too.
